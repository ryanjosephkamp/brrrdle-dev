# Progress Step Report — Phase 11

## Step
- **Major step / phase**: Phase 11 — Final Integration, Release Readiness, and Deployment Verification
- **Implementation-plan reference**: `AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`, Phase 11
- **Report file**: `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-11.md`
- **Date updated**: 2026-05-26
- **Status**: Complete — awaiting production release review

## Summary of Changes
- Ran full automated release verification for the implemented v1 launch scope.
- Identified and fixed a scoped v1 blocker: Pay-to-Continue calculators existed but gameplay UI did not expose Pay-to-Continue in `og` or `go`.
- Added Pay-to-Continue loss-state UI for `og` and `go` with insufficient-balance messaging, affordable coin spending, and one additional attempt.
- Added `continueGoAfterLoss` to continue the failed current `go` puzzle and covered it with a unit test.
- Updated release/deployment docs to document update checks, protected `/api/admin-refresh`, Hard Mode, and Pay-to-Continue verification.
- Updated `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` for final release readiness.
- Completed production-preview smoke checks for daily fixed length, practice launch lengths, Pay-to-Continue, settings/export/reset, admin locked state, manifest, service worker, and preview shell assets.

## Files Changed
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `README.md`
- `docs/deployment.md`
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv`
- `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-11.md`
- `src/app/App.tsx`
- `src/app/GoGame.tsx`
- `src/app/OgGame.tsx`
- `src/game/go/session.test.ts`
- `src/game/go/session.ts`

## Verification
- **Checks run**:
  - `npm ci`.
  - Baseline `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` before Phase 11 code changes.
  - Post-fix `npm run test` — 29 test files, 97 tests passed.
  - Post-fix `npm run lint`.
  - Post-fix `npm run build`.
  - `git diff --check`.
  - Production preview smoke check at `http://127.0.0.1:4174/`.
  - Browser smoke: `og` daily remains 5 letters and can complete with share text and definitions.
  - Browser smoke: `go` daily remains 5 letters and starts a five-puzzle chain.
  - Browser smoke: practice launch seed lengths 2, 5, and 35 are selectable.
  - Browser smoke: `og` Pay-to-Continue blocks insufficient coins and spends coins/resumes when affordable.
  - Browser smoke: `go` Pay-to-Continue spends coins and resumes the failed current puzzle when affordable.
  - Browser smoke: guest settings expose local progress export text and reset control.
  - Browser smoke: admin route remains locked when Supabase is unconfigured.
  - Browser smoke: no console messages were present during initial production-preview review.
  - Preview asset checks for `/`, `/manifest.webmanifest`, and `/brrrdle-sw.js`.
  - Manifest JSON validation with `python -m json.tool`.
  - Release readiness static validation for scripts, `vercel.json`, docs frontmatter, Pay-to-Continue docs, and `/api/admin-refresh` docs.
  - Static secret/config review; matches are public placeholder Supabase env names/values or explicit warnings, not committed secrets.
  - Progress CSV validation.
  - CodeQL/security review after Phase 11 changes: 0 alerts.
- **Checks not run**:
  - Lighthouse score target.
  - Live Vercel deployment.
  - Live GitHub Pages deployment.
  - Live Supabase auth, cloud sync, and authenticated admin refresh verification.
  - Cross-browser matrix beyond the available browser environment.
- **Reason any checks were skipped**:
  - Lighthouse, live deployment services, and Supabase project credentials are not available as repository scripts or environment resources here.
  - The repository does not define a multi-browser test matrix.

## Blockers, Errors, or Critical Notes
- No remaining blockers found in this environment.
- The one Phase 11 blocker found — missing gameplay Pay-to-Continue UI — was fixed and verified.
- Live Supabase/admin and deployment checks remain production-environment responsibilities because credentials and deployment targets are not available in this sandbox.

## User Action Required Before Next Step
- Review Phase 11 final integration, release readiness docs, changelog, and progress artifacts.
- Confirm whether to proceed with production release review/deployment activities outside this sandbox.

## Authorization to Proceed
- **Safe/authorized to proceed to next major step?**: Yes, pending explicit production release review confirmation.
- **Next major step**: Production release review.
- **Exact approval needed, if any**: Please reply with explicit production release approval or deployment instructions.

## Additional Notes / Annotations
- Phase 11 is complete and awaiting production release review.
