# Progress Step Report — Phase 3

## Step
- **Major step / phase**: Phase 3 — Application Shell, Routing, and UI Foundation
- **Implementation-plan reference**: `AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`, Phase 3
- **Report file**: `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-3.md`
- **Date updated**: 2026-05-26
- **Status**: In progress — Step 3.2 complete, awaiting user confirmation before Step 3.3

## Summary of Changes
- Added minimal app route definitions for home, daily `og`, daily `go`, practice, definitions, stats, settings, and admin shell destinations.
- Added route grouping helpers and tests to keep play/support navigation explicit.
- Added an accessible app layout with header, primary navigation, and main content landmark.
- Added keyboard-focusable navigation buttons with active page state.
- Added a mode-selection home surface for daily `og`, daily `go`, and practice placeholders.
- Replaced the Phase 0 placeholder `src/App.tsx` with the Phase 3 app shell entry point.
- Surfaced launch constraints in the shell: daily modes fixed at 5 letters, practice range 2–35, bundled seed lengths 2, 5, and 35.
- Added dark-first icy CSS custom properties, global focus-friendly defaults, selection styling, and reduced-motion behavior.
- Added reusable UI primitives for buttons, panels, dialogs, toasts, loading states, and error states.
- Integrated UI primitives into the shell without enabling unfinished gameplay, persistence, definitions, account, or admin behavior.
- Added a non-gameplay dialog smoke surface and admin locked-state alert for accessibility/state verification.
- Added a tiny class-name helper and unit test for reusable UI composition.

## Verification
- **Checks run**:
  - `npm ci` baseline dependency install from lockfile before edits.
  - Baseline `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` before Step 3.2 edits.
  - `npm run test` — 12 test files, 53 tests passed.
  - `npm run lint`.
  - `npm run build`.
  - Browser smoke check at mobile viewport `390x844`.
  - Browser smoke check at desktop viewport `1280x900`.
  - Dialog smoke check: open via keyboard-focusable button and close with `Escape`.
  - Keyboard tab navigation smoke check reached primary shell controls and the shell notes control.
  - Admin route smoke check displayed the locked-state alert.
  - Console check showed no application errors.
  - Progress CSV validation.
  - CodeQL/security review after Step 3.2 changes: 0 alerts.
- **Checks not run**:
  - Full automated accessibility audit.
  - Gameplay smoke tests.
- **Reason any checks were skipped**:
  - Step 3.2 establishes shell and design-system primitives only; gameplay is scheduled for later phases.
  - No automated accessibility tooling exists in the repository yet, so accessibility checks were manual smoke checks.

## Blockers, Errors, or Critical Notes
- No blockers.
- During mobile smoke testing, the toast region initially intercepted the shell notes button; the toast region was corrected to be non-interactive before completion.
- Shell routes intentionally expose placeholders only; no unfinished gameplay, persistence, definitions, account, or admin behavior is active.

## User Action Required Before Next Step
- Review Step 3.2 design tokens, UI primitives, accessibility shell states, tests, changelog, and progress artifacts.
- Provide explicit approval before Step 3.3 begins.

## Authorization to Proceed
- **Safe/authorized to proceed to next major step?**: Yes, pending explicit user approval.
- **Next major step**: Phase 3 Step 3.3 — Keyboard Input Foundation.
- **Exact approval needed, if any**: Please reply with explicit approval such as “Proceed to Step 3.3” or “APPROVE Phase 3 Step 3.3”.

## Additional Notes / Annotations
- Phase 3 remains open until Step 3.3 is completed, verified, and approved.
