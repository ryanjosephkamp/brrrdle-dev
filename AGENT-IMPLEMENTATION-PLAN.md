# AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md

**Project**: brrrdle  
**Plan Version**: 1.0  
**Date**: 2026-05-25  
**Status**: Draft for user review  
**Authority**: Must follow `CONSTITUTION.md`, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, and the approved v2.6 plan in `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`.

---

## 1. Operating Rules

This plan is the working implementation guide for building `brrrdle`. It is not approved until the user explicitly approves it. No implementation work may begin before that approval.

### 1.1 Binding Principles

- Build only the approved v1 scope.
- Keep daily `og` and `go` modes fixed at 5 letters for initial launch.
- Support practice mode lengths 2 through 35.
- Use the hybrid word-list strategy: bundled pre-processed JSON at build time plus production update checks and protected manual admin refresh.
- Prefer pre-processed definitions, then Dictionary API, then Wiktionary, then an always-available dynamic Google search button.
- Protect admin functionality with Supabase authentication and an `admin` role.
- Target Vercel for the game and GitHub Pages + Jekyll for blog/docs.
- Make small, reviewable changes and verify after every meaningful step.
- End every phase with a commit, changelog update, verification summary, and explicit pause for user approval.

### 1.2 Repository Starting Point

The repository is currently minimal and contains only governance/specification documents. Phase 0 will scaffold the application and establish tooling before feature implementation.

### 1.3 Standard Phase Exit Checklist

Every phase must finish with:

1. Relevant files created or updated.
2. Changelog updated.
3. Existing lint/build/test commands run where available.
4. Phase-specific verification completed.
5. Known limitations documented.
6. Changes committed and pushed through the approved workflow.
7. Explicit halt for user approval before continuing.

## 15. Known Constraints and Clarifications

- This plan does not approve implementation by itself; explicit user approval is required before Phase 0 begins.
- Real Supabase and deployment verification may require project credentials or dashboard access outside the local sandbox. If unavailable, the agent must document what was verified locally and what remains for the user to verify.
- Full English OpenList assets may be large. The agent must choose a strategy that satisfies build-time bundling and performance requirements without harming daily-mode load performance.
- No service-role secret, API key, or privileged credential may be committed.
- Any requirement conflict must stop work for user clarification.
