**Project**: brrrdle  
**Plan Version**: 3.0
**Date**: 2026-06-03
**Status**: Draft for user review — amended with Hugging Face word-list source integration; further amended on 2026-05-27 with the `ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md` addendum (see §18); further amended on 2026-05-27 with the `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-ADMIN-TAB-2026-05-27.md` addendum (see §19); further amended on 2026-05-27 with the `AUTH-UX-IMPROVEMENTS-SPEC-2026-05-27.md` addendum (see §20); further amended on 2026-05-28 with the Mobile & Tablet Responsiveness phase (see §21); further amended on 2026-05-28 with the Local Word Lists addendum (`LOCAL-WORD-LISTS-SPEC-2026-05-28.md`) as Phase 17 (see §22); further amended on 2026-05-28 with the Word List Difficulty Tiers + Word Explorer / Go / Settings improvements addendum (`PHASE-18-WORD-DIFFICULTY-AND-GO-IMPROVEMENTS-SPEC-2026-05-28.md`) as Phase 18 (see §23), whose §23.2 (Phase 18.0) performs an approved model-agnostic governance/repo cleanup and a root `README.md` upgrade in the planning stage; further amended on 2026-05-30 (v1.9) to integrate the user's definitive answers to the five §23.11 open questions (now recorded as resolved decisions) and to record the Phase 18.0 `README.md` upgrade; further amended on 2026-05-30 (v2.0) to record that Phase 18 **Prompt 2** has applied the approved constitution phase-range amendment (`CONSTITUTION.md` §1/§4/§5/§5.2/§17, v3.1 → v3.2) and the associated repo/doc adjustments, ahead of Prompt 3 (full Phase 18 feature execution); further amended on 2026-05-30 (v2.1) to append the Phase 19 addendum (`PHASE-19-ENHANCED-STATS-RESUME-CONFIGURABLE-GO-AND-POLISH-SPEC-2026-05-30.md`) as §24 (Phase 19 — Enhanced Statistics Visualizations, Configurable Go Puzzle Count, Full Resume-Most-Recent-Game Activation, Advanced Polish & Theming Foundations), whose §24.2 (Phase 19.0) performs the approved planning-stage governance/repo cleanup and a root `README.md` polish while deferring all game code changes (sub-phases 19.1–19.6) to explicit user approval ("Start Prompt 2" or equivalent); further amended on 2026-05-30 (v2.2) to record that Phase 19 **Prompt 2** has confirmed the planning-stage progress-step numbering decision (`phase_id = 46` / `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-46.md`, approved by the user) and applied the associated small clarity/governance adjustments (no game code), ahead of Prompt 3 (full Phase 19 feature execution, sub-phases 19.1–19.6); further amended on 2026-05-31 (v2.3) to upgrade `CONSTITUTION.md` to v3.3 for multi-agent workflow governance and append the Phase 20 addendum (`PHASE-20-DRAMATIC-UI-LAYOUT-EXPLORATION-SPEC-2026-05-30.md`) as §25, with governance-only tracking at `phase_id = 54`; further amended on 2026-06-01 (v2.4) to record Phase 20 completion (Variant 03 "Lunar Signal Deck" finalized) and append the Phase 21 addendum (`PHASE-21-UI-POLISH-AND-THEMING-FOUNDATION-SPEC-2026-06-01.md`) as §26 (Phase 21 — UI Polish & Theming Foundation), whose Prompt 1 is a planning + governance-only step (no UI polish, layout, or theming-foundation code) tracked at `phase_id = 59`, ahead of Prompt 2 (full Phase 21 execution); further amended on 2026-06-01 (v2.5) to record Phase 21 **Prompt 2**, a governance-only refined-instruction update incorporating the user's clarifications (keep the Lunar Signal Deck layout/tab structure mostly the same, adopt a very minimalist default background of plain black or a simple grid pattern, and capture the current Lunar Signal Deck visual style as one individual theme to be enabled in Phase 22) into the spec, §26, changelog, and progress at `phase_id = 60` — with no code, UI, layout, or theming-foundation changes — ahead of Prompt 3 (full Phase 21 execution); further amended on 2026-06-02 (v2.6) to record Phase 21 **Prompt 3** (full execution, `phase_id = 61`): added the `src/theme/surface.ts` surface-theme foundation (`minimal` default + `lunar-signal`), adopted a minimalist near-black default backdrop with a faint static grid, captured the original Lunar Signal Deck treatment as the single opt-in `lunar-signal` surface (gated by a `data-surface` attribute, to be enabled in Phase 22), and removed dead Phase-20 exploration CSS (`prism` and `command-shell` shells) plus the unused `Layout` component — with the Lunar Signal Deck layout/tab structure and every gameplay/accent-theme/stats/auth/resume/economy/sharing behavior preserved, and the Phase 22 theming system itself not implemented; further amended on 2026-06-02 (v2.7) to incorporate the **Phase 21 Addendum – Theme Proposal Templates** spec (`PHASE-21-THEME-PROPOSAL-TEMPLATES-SPEC-2026-06-02.md`) as a governance/planning-only step appended at §26.8, recording the new `themes/proposals/template_proposals/` + `full_proposals/` + `theme_proposals.csv` structure that Phase 21 must produce before closing, tracked at `phase_id = 62` — with no theme code, no proposal Markdown files, no CSV population, and no folder creation in this step (the requested "§26.1" addendum is recorded as §26.8 because the §26.1–§26.7 slots were already occupied, and the version advances to v2.7 because v2.6 was already consumed by the Phase 21 Prompt 3 full-execution amendment above); further amended on 2026-06-02 (v2.8) to incorporate the **Phase 22 – Advanced Calendar / Midnight Handling + Timezone-Aware Daily Reset (+ Targeted Bug Fixes)** spec (`PHASE-22-CALENDAR-MIDNIGHT-AND-BUGFIXES-SPEC-2026-06-02.md`) as §27, a planning + governance-only step (Prompt 1) that records the phase goals, scope, deliverables, verification requirements, and two-prompt workflow and makes Phase 22 the active next phase — with **no** daily-rollover, timezone, countdown, reset-alert, sound, dev-tool, or other source code implemented in this step (tracked at `phase_id = 64`), ahead of Prompt 2 (full Phase 22 execution); further amended on 2026-06-03 (v2.9) to record that Phase 22 **Prompt 2** (full execution) is complete (`phase_id = 65`) — timezone-aware local-midnight daily reset, balanced anti-gaming, cross-page countdown indicator, reset alert + brand-new unique sound, global Settings toggle, dev-mode Simulate Time tool, and the modular `src/daily/` service — and to incorporate the **Phase 22 Addendum – Calendar (Central Daily Hub) & Countdown Positioning** spec (`PHASE-22-ADDENDUM-CALENDAR-AND-COUNTDOWN-POSITIONING-2026-06-03.md`) as §27.10, a planning + governance-only step that records the Calendar-as-central-daily-hub feature (first tab, "Play Today's OG/GO" quick-access buttons, coin-gated past dailies with a one-guess-permanently-unlocks rule, past dailies treated as full daily experiences), the countdown repositioning to the top of the UI (context-aware on the landing page vs. game tabs), and the deliverables/scope/verification — with **no** calendar, navigation, routing, state-management, countdown-repositioning, economy, or other source code implemented in this step (tracked at `phase_id = 66`), ahead of a separately approved full-execution prompt.
**Authority**: Must follow `CONSTITUTION.md`, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, and the approved v2.6 plan in `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`.

> **Upcoming planned roadmap (not yet specced into this plan):** following Phase 22, additional planned phases through Phase 26 cover future scope such as a dramatic theming system (built on the Phase 21 foundation and the §26.8 theme proposal templates), a consumables shop, and multiplayer. These are listed here only for roadmap awareness; no work on Phases 23–26 may begin until each is approved and added as its own addendum.

## 1. Operating Rules

This plan is the working implementation guide for building `brrrdle`. It is not approved until the user explicitly approves it. No implementation work may begin before that approval.

### 1.1 Binding Principles

- Build only the approved v1 scope.
- Keep daily `og` and `go` modes fixed at 5 letters for initial launch.
- Support practice mode lengths 2 through 35.
- Use the hybrid word-list strategy: bundle pre-processed JSON sourced from the `latest/brrrdle/` folder of the `https://huggingface.co/datasets/ryanjosephkamp/english-openlist` dataset at build time, paired with a daily scheduled refresh around 12 AM (after the upstream ~11 PM nightly regeneration), production update checks, and a protected manual admin refresh.
- Treat `latest/brrrdle/` in the Hugging Face dataset as the authoritative upstream source. It contains exactly 34 JSON dictionaries — one per valid word length from 2 through 35 — and the brrrdle app must keep its served dictionaries in sync with that folder on a daily cadence.
- Prefer pre-processed definitions, then Dictionary API, then Wiktionary, then an always-available dynamic Google search button.
- Protect admin functionality with Supabase authentication and an `admin` role.
- Target Vercel for the game and GitHub Pages + Jekyll for blog/docs.
- Make small, reviewable changes and verify after every meaningful step.
- End every phase with a commit, changelog update, verification summary, and explicit pause for user approval.
- Maintain progress tracking through `PROGRESS.csv` and per-phase markdown reports before and after every major phase gate.

### 1.2 Repository Starting Point

The repository is currently minimal and contains only governance/specification documents. Phase 0 will scaffold the application and establish tooling before feature implementation.

### 1.3 Standard Phase Exit Checklist

Every phase must finish with:

1. Relevant files created or updated.
2. Changelog updated.
3. Existing lint/build/test commands run where available.
4. Phase-specific verification completed.
5. `PROGRESS.csv` read before work begins for the phase, then updated with the phase result.
6. A `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` report created or updated from `progress/PROGRESS-TEMPLATE.md`, where `N` is the completed phase number.
7. Known limitations documented.
8. Changes committed and pushed through the approved workflow.
9. Explicit halt for user approval before continuing.

### 1.4 Progress Logging and Tracking Protocol

Progress tracking is mandatory for transparency, resumability, and agent coordination.

- The repository root starts with `PROGRESS.csv` and `PROGRESS-TEMPLATE.md`.
- Phase 0 scaffolding must create a root-level `progress/` folder and move both files into that folder.
- `PROGRESS.csv` must contain one row for every major implementation phase in this plan.
- Before beginning each phase, the agent must read `progress/PROGRESS.csv` and, if needed, any existing `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` files to determine the next incomplete phase and any blockers.
- After each phase, before halting at the prompt gate, the agent must update the relevant CSV row with status, verification, blockers, completion notes, and the next required action.
- After each phase, the agent must create or update `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` from the template. The report must concisely summarize what changed, record verification, note blockers or critical errors, and explicitly state whether the user is safe/authorized to proceed to the next phase.
- If a critical error or blocker arises during a phase, the relevant progress markdown file must be updated or annotated before halting.

## 2. Phase 0 — Governance, Scaffolding, and Baseline Tooling

**Goal**: Establish the project foundation without implementing game-specific behavior beyond minimal scaffold placeholders.

### Step 0.1 — Confirm Governance Baseline

**Build / modify**:
- Confirm `CONSTITUTION.md`, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`, and this plan are present and aligned.
- Confirm `PROGRESS.csv` and `PROGRESS-TEMPLATE.md` are present at the repository root before scaffolding moves them into `progress/`.
- Create or initialize `CHANGELOG.md` if it does not exist.

**Key files**:
- `CONSTITUTION.md`
- `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`
- `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`
- `AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`
- `PROGRESS.csv`
- `PROGRESS-TEMPLATE.md`
- `CHANGELOG.md`

**Verification**:
- Re-read the governance documents before changes.
- Confirm the progress tracking skeleton and template exist.
- Confirm no implementation code has been added before plan approval.

### Step 0.2 — Scaffold React/Vite Application

**Build / modify**:
- Use the ecosystem scaffold tool to create a React 19 + TypeScript + Vite app in the repository root.
- Add Tailwind CSS using supported setup commands.
- Add Zustand only when application state is introduced.
- Preserve existing governance docs.

**Key files**:
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json` or selected lockfile
- `index.html`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `tsconfig*.json`
- `src/main.tsx`
- `src/App.tsx`
- `src/index.css`
- Tailwind configuration files if required by the installed version

**Verification**:
- Install dependencies with the selected package manager.
- Run the generated build command.
- Run generated lint/test commands if present.
- Start the dev server locally only as needed for browser verification.
- Confirm governance docs remain intact.

### Step 0.3 — Establish Project Structure

**Build / modify**:
- Create a minimal directory structure for future phases without implementing features prematurely.
- Add placeholder architecture only where needed to keep imports clean.
- Create `progress/` at the repository root and move `PROGRESS.csv` and `PROGRESS-TEMPLATE.md` into it.

**Key files / directories**:
- `src/app/`
- `src/game/`
- `src/data/`
- `src/definitions/`
- `src/account/`
- `src/admin/`
- `src/stats/`
- `src/progression/`
- `src/ui/`
- `src/lib/`
- `src/types/`
- `src/test/` or project-appropriate test location
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv`
- `progress/PROGRESS-TEMPLATE.md`

**Verification**:
- Build succeeds with the scaffolded structure.
- No unused placeholder complexity that causes lint failures.
- Confirm progress tracking files were moved, not duplicated or lost.

### Step 0.4 — Configure Deployment Foundations

**Build / modify**:
- Add Vercel-ready configuration only where needed.
- Add environment variable documentation without secrets.
- Add GitHub Pages + Jekyll blog/docs foundation.

**Key files**:
- `vercel.json` if needed
- `.env.example`
- `docs/`
- `docs/_config.yml`
- `docs/index.md`
- `README.md`

**Verification**:
- Production build succeeds locally.
- Environment documentation contains no secrets.
- Jekyll docs files are static and do not interfere with Vite.

**Pause point**: Commit Phase 0, update changelog, report verification, and halt for user approval before core implementation.

---

## 3. Phase 1 — Core Game Engine and Shared Domain Model

**Goal**: Build the testable, UI-independent game rules that every mode will use.

### Step 1.1 — Domain Types and Constants

**Build / modify**:
- Define mode types, puzzle types, tile states, guess results, word lengths, daily/practice scope rules, and game status.
- Centralize constants for supported practice lengths 2–35 and daily length 5.

**Key files**:
- `src/game/types.ts`
- `src/game/constants.ts`
- `src/types/`

**Verification**:
- TypeScript build/typecheck passes.
- Unit tests cover supported length boundaries.

### Step 1.2 — Exact Tile Coloring Logic

**Build / modify**:
- Implement the canonical `getTileStates` equivalent as the only source of truth for Wordle-style coloring.
- Account for duplicate letters exactly like Wordle.

**Key files**:
- `src/game/tileStates.ts`
- `src/game/tileStates.test.ts`

**Verification**:
- Unit tests for duplicate letters, all-green, all-gray, mixed states, repeated guess letters, repeated answer letters, and lengths 2 and 35.
- Confirm no other code duplicates tile-state rules.

### Step 1.3 — Guess Validation and Hard Mode Rules

**Build / modify**:
- Implement word validation hooks against loaded word lists.
- Implement Hard Mode constraints: fixed green positions, required yellow letters, and no gray-letter reuse.

**Key files**:
- `src/game/validation.ts`
- `src/game/hardMode.ts`
- Tests for both files

**Verification**:
- Unit tests cover valid/invalid guesses, boundary lengths, and Hard Mode edge cases after mixed feedback.

### Step 1.4 — Puzzle Session State Machine

**Build / modify**:
- Implement reusable state transitions for entering letters, deleting, submitting, win/loss, continuing, and resetting.
- Keep UI concerns out of the engine.

**Key files**:
- `src/game/session.ts`
- `src/game/session.test.ts`

**Verification**:
- Unit tests cover normal play, win, loss, invalid guesses, and continuation hooks.
- Build and test commands pass.

**Pause point**: Commit Phase 1, update changelog, report verification, and halt for user approval.

## 4. Phase 2 — Data Layer and Hybrid Word List Consumption

**Goal**: Load length-indexed word data reliably using bundled pre-processed files sourced from the Hugging Face dataset `ryanjosephkamp/english-openlist`, plus production update checks, a daily scheduled refresh against that dataset, and a protected admin-triggered refresh path.

### Step 2.1 — Word Data Shape and Local Bundled Assets

**Build / modify**:
- Treat the Hugging Face dataset `https://huggingface.co/datasets/ryanjosephkamp/english-openlist` as the authoritative upstream word-list source. Specifically, consume the `latest/brrrdle/` folder, which contains exactly 34 JSON dictionaries — one per valid word length from 2 through 35 inclusive.
- Define the expected schema for the per-length JSON dictionaries (e.g., `words_length_{N}.json` or the exact filenames provided by the dataset, to be confirmed by inspecting `latest/brrrdle/` during Step 2.1).
- Bundle a known-good snapshot of `latest/brrrdle/` at build time, recording the upstream Hugging Face commit/revision used so future refreshes can be diffed and audited.
- Add a minimal development-safe seed data strategy if the full assets are not yet available locally, but production builds must use the real `latest/brrrdle/` payload.
- Ensure data supports optional definitions when present.

**Key files**:
- `src/data/types.ts`
- `src/data/wordListSchema.ts`
- `src/data/wordLists.ts`
- `src/data/bundled/` or equivalent
- A small metadata file recording the bundled Hugging Face revision (e.g., `src/data/bundled/source.json`)

**Verification**:
- Schema validation tests for representative lengths.
- Confirm length 2, length 5, and length 35 loading paths.
- Confirm the bundled snapshot contains all 34 expected length files and that its recorded source revision is reproducible.

### Step 2.2 — Length-Indexed Loader

**Build / modify**:
- Implement APIs to retrieve valid guesses, answer candidates, and definition metadata by length.
- Ensure daily modes request only length 5 while practice can request 2–35.

**Key files**:
- `src/data/loadWordList.ts`
- `src/data/wordRepository.ts`
- Tests for data access

**Verification**:
- Tests prove daily length is locked to 5.
- Tests prove practice rejects lengths outside 2–35 and loads supported boundaries.

### Step 2.3 — Production Update Check

**Build / modify**:
- Add a production-deploy-aware update check that compares bundled `latest/brrrdle/` metadata (revision and per-length checksums or sizes) with the current state of `latest/brrrdle/` on Hugging Face.
- Note that the upstream Hugging Face dataset is regenerated nightly at approximately 11 PM, so update checks should expect a fresh revision daily and surface staleness to the data layer.
- Degrade gracefully when remote checks fail (network failure, Hugging Face downtime, malformed metadata) — bundled data must remain fully playable.

**Key files**:
- `src/data/updateCheck.ts`
- `src/data/metadata.ts`
- Server/API route files appropriate to the selected Vite/Vercel setup

**Verification**:
- Tests or mocks for current, stale, failed-network, and malformed-metadata scenarios.
- Confirm no secrets, private tokens, or Hugging Face credentials are used client-side; the dataset is public, so anonymous access is sufficient.

### Step 2.4 — Data Caching and Failure UX Hooks

**Build / modify**:
- Add data status states for loading, ready, stale, failed, and fallback.
- Expose user-friendly error states to UI without blocking playable bundled data when available.

**Key files**:
- `src/data/status.ts`
- `src/data/cache.ts`
- UI integration hooks when UI exists

**Verification**:
- Tests cover failure and fallback behavior.
- Build and test commands pass.

### Step 2.5 — Daily Scheduled Hugging Face Refresh

**Build / modify**:
- Implement a server-side scheduled job (e.g., a Vercel Cron-triggered API/function route, or equivalent for the chosen hosting setup) that runs once daily at approximately 12 AM, shortly after the upstream Hugging Face dataset's ~11 PM nightly regeneration.
- The job must fetch the 34 length-indexed JSON dictionaries from the `latest/brrrdle/` folder of `https://huggingface.co/datasets/ryanjosephkamp/english-openlist` (lengths 2 through 35).
- Validate each downloaded file against the schema from Step 2.1 before swapping it in.
- Atomically replace the served set of dictionaries so a partial download or a single malformed file cannot corrupt the live word lists. Keep the previously served set available as a fallback until the new set is fully validated.
- Record the new Hugging Face revision and per-length status in update metadata so the Step 2.3 update check stays accurate.
- Log refresh outcomes (success/failure per length, source revision, timestamp) without exposing private data or credentials.
- Cooperate with the protected admin manual refresh route from Phase 8, so manual and scheduled refreshes share the same fetch/validate/swap pipeline.
- The exact timezone for "~11 PM" and "~12 AM" must be confirmed with the user before scheduling is finalized; document the chosen timezone explicitly in `docs/deployment.md` and `.env.example` (or equivalent) once selected.

**Key files**:
- Scheduled function/route under the chosen Vercel API directory (e.g., `api/cron/refresh-word-lists.ts`)
- `src/data/refresh.ts` (or equivalent) implementing the shared fetch/validate/swap pipeline
- `src/data/updateCheck.ts` (cooperation with metadata)
- `vercel.json` (cron schedule configuration)
- `docs/deployment.md` and `.env.example` for documented schedule and any non-secret config

**Verification**:
- Tests or mocks for the fetch/validate/swap pipeline covering: all 34 files succeed; one file malformed; network failure mid-refresh; Hugging Face returns an unexpected revision.
- Confirm the atomic-swap behavior leaves a working dictionary set after every failure case.
- Confirm that the scheduled route is protected appropriately (Vercel Cron signature/secret or equivalent) and is not invokable by anonymous clients.
- Confirm no Hugging Face credentials are required or committed — the dataset is public.

**Pause point**: Commit Phase 2, update changelog, report verification, and halt for user approval.

---

## 15. Known Constraints and Clarifications

- This plan does not approve implementation by itself; explicit user approval is required before Phase 0 begins.
- The authoritative upstream word-list source is the Hugging Face dataset `https://huggingface.co/datasets/ryanjosephkamp/english-openlist`. Specifically, the `latest/brrrdle/` folder contains the 34 length-indexed JSON dictionaries (one per length from 2 through 35) that brrrdle consumes.
- The upstream Hugging Face dataset is updated nightly at approximately 11 PM, and the brrrdle scheduled refresh must run at approximately 12 AM. The exact timezone for both the upstream regeneration and the brrrdle refresh must be confirmed with the user before Phase 2's scheduled job is finalized; documentation will use this confirmed timezone explicitly rather than ambiguous "11 PM / 12 AM" phrasing.
- The Hugging Face dataset is public, so anonymous read access is sufficient; no Hugging Face credentials may be committed or shipped to the client bundle.
- Real Supabase and deployment verification may require project credentials or dashboard access outside the local sandbox. If unavailable, the agent must document what was verified locally and what remains for the user to verify.
- Full English OpenList assets may be large. The agent must choose a strategy that satisfies build-time bundling and performance requirements without harming daily-mode load performance.
- No service-role secret, API key, or privileged credential may be committed.
- Any requirement conflict must stop work for user clarification.

## 16. Phase 12 — Fix Build Errors, Length Selector, and Polish Artifacts (Diagnosis Report 2026-05-26)

**Authority**: This phase implements the recommended fix strategy from `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-2026-05-26.md` while strictly observing `CONSTITUTION.md` (scope fidelity, minimal change, verification-first execution, data safety, and progress tracking). It must not introduce out-of-scope v1 features.

**Goal**: Restore a clean production build of the Vercel serverless layer, remove a leftover Phase 9 debug toast, and make the practice length selector and guess validation work across the full 2–35 length range using the existing hybrid data strategy. After this phase, both visible user-facing issues and the underlying TypeScript build errors must be resolved.

**Scope boundary**: No new game features, no economy changes, no Supabase schema changes, no new external dependencies beyond what is strictly required to fix the diagnosed issues. Do not rewrite phases 0–11. Do not change daily-mode performance characteristics.

### Step 12.1 — Re-confirm Diagnosis Against the Current Repository

**Build / modify**:
- No code changes in this step.

**Verification**:
- Read `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-2026-05-26.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md`, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, and the most recent Phase 12/13 progress reports (`progress/PROGRESS-STEP-12.md`, `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-13.md`).
- Run `npm ci`, `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build` to capture the current baseline failure surface locally.
- Run a standalone `tsc --noEmit` over the `api/` folder using Node16/NodeNext-style module resolution to reproduce the 18 TypeScript errors described in the diagnosis report and produce an authoritative list (file, line, error code).
- Confirm which symptoms are reproducible locally and which require a Vercel preview to observe (record any Vercel-only behavior in the progress report).

**Pause behavior**: This step does not halt; it feeds the remaining steps with a verified error list.

### Step 12.2 — Establish a Dedicated TypeScript Project for `api/`

**Build / modify**:
- Add a third TypeScript project reference for the Vercel serverless functions (e.g. `tsconfig.api.json`) that:
  - Includes only `api/**/*.ts` and the `src/` types it legitimately imports.
  - Uses module/module-resolution settings compatible with how Vercel compiles serverless functions (Node-style ESM resolution).
  - Enables `strict` and the existing `noUnusedLocals`/`noUnusedParameters`/`noFallthroughCasesInSwitch` flags, plus `resolveJsonModule` where required.
  - Sets `types` to include `node` so `process`, `Buffer`, and Node globals resolve.
- Reference the new project from the root `tsconfig.json` so `tsc -b` (used by `npm run build`) typechecks the `api/` layer alongside the app.

**Key files**:
- `tsconfig.json`
- `tsconfig.api.json` (new)
- `package.json` (no script changes expected; document the change in this plan and changelog)

**Verification**:
- `npm run build` must typecheck `api/` and fail on the diagnosed errors before Step 12.3, proving that the new project surfaces those errors locally rather than only on Vercel.
- Confirm `tsconfig.app.json` and `tsconfig.node.json` are not affected.

### Step 12.3 — Fix Relative Import Extensions and JSON Import Attributes in `api/` and `src/data/`

**Build / modify**:
- Update every relative import in `api/**/*.ts` and the `src/data/*` files referenced from `api/` to satisfy the chosen `api/` module resolution. Concretely:
  - Add explicit `.js` extensions to relative imports as required by Node16/NodeNext resolution, including imports that cross the `api/` ↔ `src/` boundary.
  - Where ESLint or the bundler may complain about `.js` extensions in `src/`, prefer keeping `src/` imports unchanged and only adjusting imports actually consumed from `api/`. If a shared module is consumed from both sides, choose the smallest path that satisfies both resolutions (e.g. relocating shared helpers under `api/_lib/` or `src/data/` cleanly).
  - Convert JSON imports that fail under the new project to use the `with { type: 'json' }` import attribute (or `assert` only as a last resort) and ensure the chosen attribute is supported by the TypeScript version pinned in `package.json`.
- Fix the implicit-`any` parameter errors (`TS7006`) flagged in `api/_lib/vercelBlobStore.ts`, `api/admin-refresh.ts`, and `api/cron/refresh-word-lists.ts` by giving each parameter an explicit, accurate type drawn from the existing data-layer types — do not use `any`.
- Fix the type mismatch in `loadWordList.ts` identified in the diagnosis report by tightening the inferred type rather than weakening callers.
- Ensure `@types/node` remains in `devDependencies` and is referenced where needed (it is already present; document that no install is required if so).

**Key files**:
- `api/_lib/vercelBlobStore.ts`
- `api/_lib/wordListStore.ts`
- `api/admin-refresh.ts`
- `api/cron/refresh-word-lists.ts`
- `api/word-lists/manifest.ts`
- `src/data/refreshStore.ts`
- `src/data/loadWordList.ts`
- Any other files surfaced by Step 12.1’s error list

**Verification**:
- `npm run build` must complete with zero TypeScript errors across `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`, and the new `tsconfig.api.json`.
- `npm run lint` must pass; ESLint configuration for `api/` may need a small adjustment if `.js` extensions on relative imports are flagged. If a rule must be relaxed, scope it to the `api/` glob only and document it.
- Re-run the standalone `api/` typecheck command used in Step 12.1; the 18 diagnosed errors must all be gone with no new errors introduced.
- Do not delete or weaken any existing tests to make this step pass.

### Step 12.4 — Remove the Leftover Phase 9 “polish ready” Floating Box

**Build / modify**:
- In `src/app/App.tsx`, remove the `shellMessages` constant and the `<ToastRegion messages={shellMessages} />` mount that produces the floating “polish ready” toast in the bottom-right of every page. Keep the underlying `ToastRegion` primitive intact for future gameplay use; remove only the debug payload and its render site.
- Also remove the adjacent “Phase 9 polish” sidebar `<Panel>` (and its `LoadingState` and Review-shell-notes button) and the “Phase 9 shell notes” `Dialog`, which are debug surfaces from the same phase. Confirm via grep that no other surface depends on them. If any test references these surfaces, update or remove only those debug-only assertions; do not weaken gameplay tests.
- Sweep for other Phase 9 debug-only leftovers in `src/app/App.tsx` (and only `App.tsx`) and remove any that the diagnosis report’s “polish ready” callout effectively covers. Do not refactor unrelated logic.

**Key files**:
- `src/app/App.tsx`

**Verification**:
- After the change, no `"polish ready"`, `"Phase 9 polish"`, or `"shell notes"` string remains in `src/app/App.tsx`.
- `npm run lint` and `npm run build` pass.
- Manual smoke check (documented in the progress report) confirms that loading the app no longer shows the floating bottom-right box.
- Existing `og` and `go` gameplay routes still render and remain playable.

### Step 12.5 — Drive Practice Length Selector and Guess Validation From the Full 2–35 Data Layer

**Build / modify**:
- Replace the use of `BUNDLED_WORD_LIST_LENGTHS` (currently `[2, 5, 35]`) as the source of available practice lengths everywhere the selector is rendered and everywhere `og`/`go` practice sessions compute their allowed lengths. The full supported set is `MIN_PRACTICE_WORD_LENGTH`..`MAX_PRACTICE_WORD_LENGTH` (2..35), already defined in `src/game/constants.ts`.
- Introduce a single helper (e.g. `getSupportedPracticeLengths()` in `src/data/index.ts` or `src/game/constants.ts`) that returns the canonical 2..35 range, and have `OgGame`, `GoGame`, and the home shell consume it. Keep `BUNDLED_WORD_LIST_LENGTHS` for accurate “which lengths are seed-bundled” diagnostics only.
- Extend the bundled word-list assets in `src/data/bundled/` so practice play has a working answer set and `validGuesses` set for every length 2..35. Source the content from the existing Hugging Face dataset pipeline (`src/data/huggingFaceSource.ts` + `refresh.ts`) by running the pipeline once locally and committing the resulting 34 `words_length_<N>.json` files as bundled snapshots. This preserves the “bundle pre-processed JSON at production build time” rule in CONSTITUTION §8.2 and removes the “word not in list” regression caused by tiny seed lists.
  - If a length’s upstream file is too large to comfortably ship in the main JS bundle, switch `src/data/wordLists.ts` to dynamic, length-indexed import (`import()`) so daily mode (length 5) still loads only its file. Either approach must satisfy CONSTITUTION §8.2 and §12.4 (daily-mode performance) and §3.1 (practice 2–35). Choose whichever option keeps the daily-mode bundle size and TTI within current measurements; record the decision in the progress report.
  - Update `src/data/wordLists.ts` so the bundle map reflects the chosen strategy (either all 34 statically imported, or a `Record<number, () => Promise<WordListFile>>` lazy map) without changing the public `getWordRepository` contract — adapt callers minimally if and only if dynamic loading is chosen.
- Update `loadBundledWordList` (and any synchronous consumers it has) only as required by the chosen strategy. If dynamic loading is introduced, add an explicit async path and keep the synchronous path for daily length 5.
- Verify that practice mode no longer rejects valid words from the full lists by exercising representative guesses against lengths 2, 5, 12, 20, and 35 in unit tests.

**Key files**:
- `src/data/wordLists.ts`
- `src/data/loadWordList.ts`
- `src/data/wordRepository.ts`
- `src/data/index.ts`
- `src/data/bundled/words_length_<N>.json` for N = 2..35 (new/updated bundled snapshots)
- `src/app/OgGame.tsx`
- `src/app/GoGame.tsx`
- `src/app/App.tsx` (length-selector display only)
- `src/game/og/session.ts`
- `src/game/go/session.ts`
- Relevant `*.test.ts` files for the data layer and game sessions

**Verification**:
- Unit tests cover: practice length selector exposes every integer 2..35; `getValidGuesses` returns a non-trivial set for lengths 2, 5, 12, 20, 35; a known-valid word from the bundled list for each tested length passes validation; daily mode remains locked to length 5.
- `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, and `npm run build` pass.
- Manual smoke check (documented in the progress report): the practice length dropdown shows 2..35; submitting common words at three sampled lengths is accepted; submitting clearly invalid strings is still rejected; daily `og`/`go` still play normally.
- Data safety: imported words and definitions must still be treated as untrusted for rendering (CONSTITUTION §8.3). No unescaped HTML may be introduced.

### Step 12.6 — Verify the Persistence Layer Still Loads in Development and Production Mode

**Build / modify**:
- No new functionality. After Steps 12.2–12.3 land, re-exercise the existing persistence-layer wiring:
  - `api/_lib/vercelBlobStore.ts`, `api/_lib/wordListStore.ts`, `api/cron/refresh-word-lists.ts`, `api/admin-refresh.ts`, `api/word-lists/manifest.ts`.
- Confirm the factory still returns the documented `skipped` status when `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is absent, and the documented success path when it is present (use the existing test doubles in `src/data/refreshStore.ts`).

**Verification**:
- `npm run test` continues to cover the existing refresh-store and refresh-pipeline tests with no regressions.
- The persistence-layer unit tests for atomic swap, projection, and per-length failure must still pass unchanged.
- The build artifact must not bundle `@vercel/blob` into the client (`dist/`). Re-run the client-bundle leak check used in Phase 13.

### Step 12.7 — Documentation, Changelog, and Progress Artifacts

**Build / modify**:
- Add a new `Unreleased`/`Fixed` block to `CHANGELOG.md` describing:
  - The TypeScript build-error fixes (`.js` extensions, JSON import attribute, implicit-`any` fixes, `loadWordList.ts` type mismatch, new `tsconfig.api.json`).
  - Removal of the leftover Phase 9 “polish ready” floating box and adjacent debug surfaces.
  - Practice length selector now exposing the full 2..35 range and validation now using the full bundled (or lazily-loaded) word lists.
  - Any documentation updates required by the chosen bundling strategy in Step 12.5.
- Update `docs/deployment.md` only if the chosen Step 12.5 strategy changes operator-visible behavior. Do not introduce documentation about features outside the diagnosis report’s scope.
- Update `progress/PROGRESS.csv` with a new row for Phase 12 (`phase_id = 14`, title `"Phase 12 — Fix Build Errors, Length Selector, and Polish Artifacts"`).
- Create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-14.md` from `progress/PROGRESS-TEMPLATE.md` summarizing what changed, what verification ran, known limitations, and whether the user is safe to proceed.
- If anything cannot be completed (for example because Vercel preview access is not available to verify Step 12.6 in production), annotate the progress report with the missing check, the reason, and what was verified locally instead, per CONSTITUTION §6.2.

**Key files**:
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv`
- `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-14.md`
- `docs/deployment.md` (only if required)

**Verification**:
- The CSV row matches the progress markdown summary.
- No secrets, tokens, or private deployment data appear in any updated artifact (CONSTITUTION §5.4, §14).

### Step 12.8 — Full Verification, Security Review, and Halt

**Build / modify**:
- No new code changes in this step.

**Verification**:
- Run, in order, and record results:
  - `npm ci`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run test`
  - `npm run build`
  - Standalone `tsc --noEmit` over `api/` using the new `tsconfig.api.json` to confirm zero errors there.
  - `git diff --check`
  - The client-bundle leak check used in Phase 13 (confirm `@vercel/blob` is not in `dist/`).
- Run the available security review tool (`codeql_checker`) on the changes. Address any new alert that is a true positive in changed lines before halting (CONSTITUTION §14).
- Manual smoke checks captured in the progress report:
  - Home shell no longer shows the floating “polish ready” box.
  - Practice length dropdown shows 2..35 in `og` and `go`.
  - Representative known-valid guesses at lengths 2, 5, and 35 are accepted; invalid strings still rejected.
  - Daily `og` and daily `go` still play with length 5.
  - Existing post-game definitions, sharing, settings, and admin surfaces still render.
- Reconfirm CONSTITUTION compliance: no out-of-scope v1 features, no removed/weakened tests, no committed secrets, no service-role exposure to the client, no unescaped HTML from imported definitions, and progress artifacts updated.

**Pause point**: Commit and push all changes through the approved progress-reporting workflow. Provide the required review-gate summary (what changed, what was verified, limitations, progress CSV + step report links, exact approval needed) and halt for explicit user approval before any production deployment action.

### Phase 12 Exit Checklist

- All 18 TypeScript build errors from the diagnosis report are resolved.
- The floating Phase 9 “polish ready” box and adjacent Phase 9 debug surfaces are removed from `src/app/App.tsx`.
- Practice mode exposes every length 2..35 in `og` and `go`, and guess validation uses the full bundled (or lazily-loaded) word lists.
- The persistence layer continues to behave as in Phase 13 (atomic swap, factory skip-when-unconfigured, no `@vercel/blob` in the client bundle).
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, and `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-14.md` are updated and free of secrets.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and the standalone `api/` typecheck all pass; `codeql_checker` is run and any true-positive alert in changed lines is fixed.
- Halt for explicit user approval before any production release action.

## 17. Phase 12 — Fix Build Errors, Length Selector, and Polish Artifacts (Updated Diagnosis Report 2026-05-26)

**Authority**: This section supersedes Section 16 as the active fix plan for the issues called out in the updated `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-2026-05-26.md` (the version dated 2026-05-26 with the "Phase 12 fixes were insufficient" status). It is bound by `CONSTITUTION.md` (scope fidelity, minimal change, verification-first execution, hybrid data-layer discipline, data safety, progress logging) and by `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`. No new v1 scope is added.

**Goal**: Finish the work begun in Section 16 by (a) eliminating the TypeScript build errors that the updated diagnosis report says are still reaching the Vercel build, (b) ensuring the practice length selector and the guess validator actually use the full 2–35 data layer in production rather than falling back to the small seed slice, and (c) removing every leftover Phase 9 debug surface (the "polish ready" floating box and its peers). After this section, both visible user-facing problems and the underlying build/runtime mismatch must be resolved end-to-end, locally and on Vercel.

**Scope boundary**: No new game features, no economy or stats changes, no new Supabase tables, no new client-side runtime dependencies. Do not change the daily-mode word length, the Hugging Face source contract, or the persistence-layer atomic-swap semantics. Do not rewrite Phases 0–11 or the persistence layer from Phase 13.

**Inputs to reconcile before editing**:
- `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-2026-05-26.md` (updated version) — authoritative symptom list.
- `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-14.md` — what Section 16 actually shipped (real bundled content for lengths 2–18, deterministic synthetic placeholders for 19–35, new `tsconfig.api.json`, removed "polish ready" toast).
- Latest Vercel build logs supplied with the updated diagnosis report — authoritative for any error that does not reproduce locally.
- `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md` §§ on daily length, practice length range, and definitions.

### Step 12U.1 — Reconcile the Updated Diagnosis Against the Current Repository

**Build / modify**:
- No code changes in this step.

**Verification**:
- Re-read the updated `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-2026-05-26.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md` §§ 2, 5.4, 6, 8, 12, 14, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, and `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-12.md`, `PROGRESS-STEP-13.md`, `PROGRESS-STEP-14.md`.
- Run, in order, and capture the full output for the progress report:
  - `npm ci`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run test`
  - `npm run build` (which runs `tsc -b && vite build` and so exercises `tsconfig.api.json` via the project references added in Section 16)
  - Standalone `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit`
- For every error class the updated diagnosis lists (missing `.js` extensions; missing exports from `src/data/index.ts` such as `HUGGING_FACE_API_BASE`, `HUGGING_FACE_DATASET_ID`, `fetchHuggingFaceRemoteMetadata`, `refreshWordListsFromHuggingFace`; JSON import attribute issues; `loadWordList.ts` type mismatch), record whether it (a) still reproduces locally, (b) only reproduces on Vercel, or (c) is already fixed. This authoritative reproduction map drives Steps 12U.2–12U.4.
- For every user-visible symptom (practice dropdown shows 2/5/35, "word not in list" for valid words, "polish ready" floating box), reproduce locally via `npm run dev` (or `vite preview` after a build) and record the screenshot/notes.
- If any diagnosed error does **not** reproduce locally, gather the Vercel build log lines the user supplied, identify the exact upstream commit Vercel built, and check whether that commit predates Section 16. If so, the fix is "trigger a clean Vercel rebuild" and the only code-side work is whatever truly reproduces locally — document this clearly in the progress report.

**Halt behavior**: This step does not halt; it produces the reproduction map for the rest of Section 17.

### Step 12U.2 — Make the `api/` ↔ `src/data/` Boundary Robust Under Node16/NodeNext Resolution

**Build / modify** (only if Step 12U.1's reproduction map shows the errors still occur):
- For every relative import inside `api/**/*.ts` that crosses into `src/`, confirm the import path uses an explicit `.js` extension and matches the file that exists in `src/`. Add the extension where missing. Do not change `src/` → `src/` imports unless the api project actually pulls that module in.
- For every symbol the updated diagnosis says is missing from `src/data/index.ts` (`HUGGING_FACE_API_BASE`, `HUGGING_FACE_DATASET_ID`, `HUGGING_FACE_RAW_BASE`, `fetchHuggingFaceRemoteMetadata`, `refreshWordListsFromHuggingFace`, `type RefreshSourceInfo`, plus any other symbol the api files import via the barrel), verify the barrel re-exports it. If a symbol is not actually exported from its source module, export it from that module first, then re-export from `src/data/index.ts`. Do not introduce wildcard re-exports that change public API surface.
- If `api/` files reach into `src/data` modules via deep paths (`../src/data/refreshStore.js`, etc.) and that bypasses the barrel, leave the deep imports as-is and only verify the deep target itself exports the symbol with the expected name. Prefer deep imports for api ↔ data crossings to avoid increasing the client barrel surface.
- For any JSON import the api project consumes (manifest JSON, bundled JSON, etc.), confirm the import syntax matches the TypeScript version pinned in `package.json`. Use `with { type: 'json' }` import attributes if and only if the pinned TS version supports them; otherwise keep the established pattern (`resolveJsonModule` + default import) used elsewhere in `src/data/`. Do not mix patterns inside the same project.
- Fix the `loadWordList.ts` type mismatch flagged in the updated diagnosis by tightening the inferred type at the source rather than weakening callers; if the diagnosis report does not pinpoint the exact line, derive it from Step 12U.1's reproduction map.
- Keep `tsconfig.api.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, and `tsconfig.node.json` separately scoped. Do not relax `strict`, `noUnusedLocals`, `noUnusedParameters`, `noFallthroughCasesInSwitch`, or `verbatimModuleSyntax` to silence errors.

**Key files** (final list driven by Step 12U.1):
- `src/data/index.ts`
- `src/data/huggingFaceSource.ts`
- `src/data/refresh.ts`
- `src/data/refreshStore.ts`
- `src/data/loadWordList.ts`
- `src/data/wordLists.ts` (only if JSON import pattern changes)
- `api/admin-refresh.ts`
- `api/cron/refresh-word-lists.ts`
- `api/word-lists/manifest.ts`
- `api/_lib/wordListStore.ts`
- `api/_lib/vercelBlobStore.ts`
- `tsconfig.api.json` (only if a setting actually has to change; document why)

**Verification**:
- `npm run build` exits 0 with zero TypeScript errors across all three tsconfigs.
- `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` exits 0.
- `npm run lint` exits 0.
- `npm run test` exits 0 (no test deletions or weakenings; if a test asserts an exported symbol now exists, it stays).
- A Vercel preview build (or, if Vercel access is unavailable, a local clean build invoked exactly as `vercel build` would) reports the same zero-error result. If Vercel cannot be exercised from the sandbox, document the limitation under CONSTITUTION §6.2 and ask the user to trigger a manual Vercel rebuild as the final verification.

### Step 12U.3 — Ensure the Practice Length Selector and Guess Validator Use the Full 2–35 Range in Production

**Build / modify**:
- Audit every consumer of `BUNDLED_WORD_LIST_LENGTHS`, `getAvailableOgPracticeLengths()`, and `getAvailableGoPracticeLengths()` in `src/app/`, `src/game/`, and `src/data/`. The selector and the validator must derive their length set from `SUPPORTED_PRACTICE_WORD_LENGTHS` (2..35), filtered only by which lengths actually have a usable word list available at runtime, not by whether they were originally hand-seeded.
- If any code path still treats `BUNDLED_WORD_LIST_LENGTHS` as the "what the user is allowed to pick" set, rewrite that code path to use the supported practice range and to gate per-length availability on `loadBundledWordList(...).ok`. Keep `BUNDLED_WORD_LIST_LENGTHS` strictly as a diagnostic value (`bundled lengths` display only).
- Confirm that the bundled JSON for every length 2..35 (a) loads cleanly through `loadBundledWordList`, (b) returns a non-empty `validGuesses` set, and (c) returns at least one valid answer. If a length still ships with placeholder content that fails validation or produces "word not in list" for ordinary English words at that length, replace its placeholder with a real dictionary slice from the existing Hugging Face pipeline (`refreshWordListsFromHuggingFace`/local pipeline run) under `src/data/bundled/words_length_<N>.json`. Real content is preferred for every length 2..35. If a length's upstream dictionary is so large it would noticeably increase the client bundle size, switch only those lengths to length-indexed dynamic `import()` so daily mode (length 5) still loads only its file; daily-mode load characteristics must not regress (CONSTITUTION §12.4). Record the chosen strategy per length range in the progress report.
- Where the bundled answer pool for a given length is intentionally small (e.g., very long words), make sure the validator still uses the full `validGuesses` set for that length, not just the answer pool. This avoids the "valid word rejected" symptom from the updated diagnosis even when answer pools are small.
- Update `src/data/wordRepository.ts` and the OG/GO session selectors only as much as needed to honor the above and to keep the public `getWordRepository` contract stable. If a dynamic-import path is introduced, gate it behind an explicit async API and keep the synchronous path for daily length 5.

**Key files**:
- `src/data/wordLists.ts`
- `src/data/loadWordList.ts`
- `src/data/wordRepository.ts`
- `src/data/index.ts` (only if a new helper is exported)
- `src/data/bundled/words_length_<N>.json` for every N in 2..35 that still ships placeholder content
- `src/app/App.tsx` (length-selector display only, not behavior)
- `src/app/OgGame.tsx`
- `src/app/GoGame.tsx`
- `src/game/og/session.ts`
- `src/game/go/session.ts`
- `src/game/constants.ts` (only if a new derived helper is introduced)

**Verification**:
- New or updated unit tests cover:
  - `getAvailableOgPracticeLengths()` and `getAvailableGoPracticeLengths()` each return every integer 2..35.
  - `loadBundledWordList('practice', N).ok === true` for every N in 2..35.
  - A representative real English word at each of lengths 2, 5, 12, 20, and 35 is accepted by `validateGuess`. Length-35 may be exempted if and only if the upstream dataset legitimately ships no 35-letter words on a given day; the test must then verify the **graceful fallback** path rather than acceptance.
  - Daily mode remains locked to length 5 (assert at the type and the session layer).
- `npm run test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run build` all pass.
- Manual smoke check (documented in progress report): `npm run dev` shows the practice length dropdown listing every integer 2..35 in both `og` and `go`; submitting a known real word at lengths 2, 5, 12, 20, and 35 is accepted; submitting clearly invalid strings is still rejected; daily `og` and daily `go` still play normally with length 5.
- Data safety: per CONSTITUTION §8.3, no unescaped HTML may be introduced from imported word/definition data. Reuse existing definition rendering helpers.

### Step 12U.4 — Verify Removal of Every Phase 9 Debug Surface

**Build / modify**:
- Confirm Section 16 already removed the `shellMessages` `<ToastRegion>` mount, the "Phase 9 polish" sidebar `<Panel>`, the `LoadingState` filler, the "Review shell notes" button, and the "Phase 9 shell notes" `Dialog` from `src/app/App.tsx`. If any of these (or a peer leftover such as a "polish ready" string, a debug toast payload, or a debug-only panel) still exists anywhere under `src/`, remove only that debug surface — do not modify gameplay logic, accessibility primitives, or the underlying `ToastRegion`/`Panel`/`Dialog` components.
- Grep the entire `src/` tree for `polish ready`, `Phase 9`, and any debug-only string flagged by the updated diagnosis. The grep result must be empty for the user-facing strings after this step.

**Key files**:
- `src/app/App.tsx`
- Any other file the grep surfaces (expected: none)

**Verification**:
- Grep returns no matches for the debug strings above under `src/` (or under `dist/` after `npm run build`).
- Manual smoke check confirms the floating bottom-right box no longer appears on any route.
- Existing accessibility, focus order, and ToastRegion-based future surfaces remain intact (CONSTITUTION §12).

### Step 12U.5 — Re-verify the Persistence Layer End-to-End

**Build / modify**:
- No new functionality. After Steps 12U.2–12U.4, re-exercise the existing persistence-layer wiring (`api/_lib/vercelBlobStore.ts`, `api/_lib/wordListStore.ts`, `api/cron/refresh-word-lists.ts`, `api/admin-refresh.ts`, `api/word-lists/manifest.ts`) and the client-side `refreshStore.ts` projection.
- Confirm the factory still returns the documented `skipped` status when `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is absent and the documented success path when it is present (use the existing test doubles in `src/data/refreshStore.ts`). Do not invent new fixtures.

**Verification**:
- `npm run test` continues to cover the existing refresh-store and refresh-pipeline tests with no regressions and no weakened assertions.
- Atomic swap, projection, and per-length failure tests still pass unchanged.
- The build artifact must not bundle `@vercel/blob` into the client (`dist/assets/*.js`). Re-run the Phase 13 client-bundle leak check (`grep -R "@vercel/blob" dist/` returns no matches in shipped chunks) and record the result.
- The public manifest endpoint shape (`{ ok, manifest }` / `{ ok: false, reason }`) and HTTP cache headers from `api/word-lists/manifest.ts` are unchanged.

### Step 12U.6 — Documentation, Changelog, and Progress Artifacts

**Build / modify**:
- Add a new `[Unreleased] — Fixed` block to `CHANGELOG.md` describing:
  - Resolution of the residual TypeScript build errors from the updated diagnosis (missing `.js` extensions across `api/`/`src/data/` boundary, missing barrel re-exports from `src/data/index.ts`, JSON import attribute alignment, `loadWordList.ts` type mismatch).
  - Practice length selector now exposing the full 2..35 range from real (or, where real content is unavailable, gracefully-handled) bundled data, with the "word not in list" regression resolved.
  - Removal of any remaining Phase 9 debug surface.
  - Any documentation update required by the bundling strategy chosen in Step 12U.3 (e.g., note about dynamic-import lengths).
- Update `docs/deployment.md` only if Step 12U.3's strategy changes operator-visible behavior (for example, if length-indexed dynamic imports change preview deployment expectations). Do not introduce documentation about features outside the diagnosis report's scope.
- Append a new row to `progress/PROGRESS.csv` for this section using `phase_id = 15`, title `"Phase 12 — Fix Build Errors, Length Selector, and Polish Artifacts (Updated Diagnosis Report 2026-05-26)"`. Reuse the prompt-gate/next-step columns consistently with prior rows.
- Create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-15.md` from `progress/PROGRESS-TEMPLATE.md` summarizing what changed across Steps 12U.1–12U.6, what verification ran, known limitations (including any Vercel-only verification the agent could not perform), and whether the user is safe/authorized to proceed to a standard release review.
- If any step cannot be completed (for example because Vercel preview access is not available), annotate the progress markdown with the missing check, the reason, and what was verified locally instead, per CONSTITUTION §6.2.

**Key files**:
- `CHANGELOG.md`
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv`
- `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-15.md`
- `docs/deployment.md` (only if required)

**Verification**:
- The new CSV row matches the progress markdown summary exactly.
- No secrets, tokens, deploy URLs containing internal identifiers, or private deployment data appear in any updated artifact (CONSTITUTION §5.4, §14).
- Changelog entry references only user-facing or build-facing behavior changes; it does not leak repository-internal debugging detail.

### Step 12U.7 — Full Verification, Security Review, and Halt

**Build / modify**:
- No new code changes in this step.

**Verification**:
- Run, in order, and record results in `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-15.md`:
  - `npm ci`
  - `npm run lint`
  - `npm run test`
  - `npm run build`
  - `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit`
  - `git diff --check`
  - The Phase 13 client-bundle leak check (confirm `@vercel/blob` is not in any `dist/assets/*.js`).
- Run `codeql_checker` on the diff. Address any true-positive alert in changed lines before halting (CONSTITUTION §14). False positives may be ignored with a written justification in the progress report.
- Manual smoke checks captured in the progress report:
  - Home shell no longer shows the floating "polish ready" box or any Phase 9 debug surface on any route.
  - Practice length dropdown shows every integer 2..35 in both `og` and `go`.
  - Known real English words at lengths 2, 5, 12, 20, and 35 are accepted; clearly invalid strings are still rejected.
  - Daily `og` and daily `go` still play normally with length 5.
  - Post-game definitions, sharing, settings, and admin surfaces still render as before.
- Reconfirm CONSTITUTION compliance: no out-of-scope v1 features; no removed or weakened tests; no committed secrets; no service-role exposure to the client; no unescaped HTML from imported definition data; progress artifacts updated; daily-mode performance unchanged.

**Pause point**: Commit and push every change through the approved progress-reporting workflow. Provide the standard review-gate summary (what changed, what was verified, limitations, links to the updated `progress/PROGRESS.csv` row and `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-15.md`, exact approval needed) and halt for explicit user approval before any production deployment action.

### Section 17 Exit Checklist

- Every error class in the updated `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-2026-05-26.md` is either resolved in code or documented as already-fixed and pending a clean Vercel rebuild, with the reproduction map preserved in `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-15.md`.
- Every Phase 9 debug surface (the "polish ready" floating box and its peers) is gone from `src/` and from the built `dist/`.
- Practice mode exposes every length 2..35 in `og` and `go`; guess validation uses the full bundled (or lazily-loaded) word lists at every length; daily mode remains locked to length 5.
- The persistence layer continues to behave as in Phase 13 (atomic swap, factory skip-when-unconfigured, no `@vercel/blob` in client bundle).
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, and `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-15.md` are updated and free of secrets or private deployment data.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and the standalone `api/` typecheck all pass; `codeql_checker` is run and any true-positive alert in changed lines is fixed.
- The agent halts and waits for explicit user approval before any production release action.

## 18. Phase 13 — Plan Addendum (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27): Word Explorer, Feedback Tab, Sound Effects, Authentication Improvements, and Repository Cleanup

**Plan Version**: 1.3 (addendum)
**Date**: 2026-05-27
**Status**: Draft for user review — implementation must NOT begin until the user explicitly approves this addendum.
**Authority**: This addendum is bound by `CONSTITUTION.md` (v3.1), `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`, prior sections of this plan, and `ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md`.

### 18.1 Scope, Source of Truth, and Operating Rules

This addendum covers the five new work streams declared in `ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md`:

1. **Word Explorer Tab** (new public tab).
2. **Feedback Tab** (new public tab).
3. **Sound Effects** (new optional in-game audio with Settings toggle).
4. **Authentication Improvements** (email + password alongside existing magic link, durable session, reliable admin role detection).
5. **Repository Cleanup & Re-organization** (safe, non-deleting reorganization with import-path updates).

Binding rules for this addendum:

- `ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md` is the source of truth for behavior; this section is the source of truth for ordering, verification, and pause points.
- No code changes are executed by writing this addendum. Implementation begins only after explicit user approval.
- No files may be deleted, renamed in a lossy way, or have existing functionality removed at any phase below. Moves are allowed (Step 18.3) but every move must be accompanied by import-path updates so behavior is preserved.
- All new tabs (Word Explorer, Feedback) must be visible to everyone, including guests (per `ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md` §"Implementation Constraints").
- Daily `og` and daily `go` remain fixed at 5 letters (CONSTITUTION §3, BRRRDLE-SPEC §3.1). Nothing in this addendum may change that.
- Every step ends with verification and an explicit halt-for-approval gate, per CONSTITUTION §5.3 and §6, and per the Standard Phase Exit Checklist in §1.3 of this plan.
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv` and a new `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` report must be created/updated for every step below before halting. `CHANGELOG.md` must receive a corresponding `[Unreleased]` entry at every step that ships user-visible or build-visible change.
- No secrets, tokens, deploy URLs containing internal identifiers, or private deployment data may appear in any artifact (CONSTITUTION §5.4, §14).
- All new code paths must pass `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` (where api/ is touched), and `codeql_checker` must be run after each step and any true-positive alert in changed lines fixed before halting (CONSTITUTION §14).
- Network calls that the sandbox cannot reach (e.g., Hugging Face, Supabase production, Vercel deploy hooks) must be recorded as documented limitations per CONSTITUTION §6.2; they must not be silently skipped.

### 18.2 Phase 13.0 — Pre-flight, Baseline, and Risk Map

**Goal**: Lock the current `main` as a known-good baseline before any addendum work begins, and produce a written risk map.

**Build / modify**: No source changes. Produce only progress artifacts.

**Activities**:
- Read `progress/PROGRESS.csv` and the most recent `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` to confirm no in-flight blockers remain from Phase 12 follow-ons.
- Confirm `CONSTITUTION.md`, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`, this plan, and `ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md` are aligned (no conflicts with daily 5-letter lock, practice 2–35, definitions ordering, admin role gate).
- Produce an internal risk map of:
  - Files most likely to move during Step 18.3 (cleanup).
  - Modules consumed by `api/` (server) so any cleanup move preserves serverless build behavior and the standalone `tsconfig.api.json` typecheck.
  - All places that currently read Supabase session/role (for the auth improvements step).
  - Places that already wire navigation order (for the new tabs).
- Record the risk map and the chosen execution order (the order in §18.1 list above) in `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-18.md`.

**Key files**:
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv` (append a new row for `phase_id = 18`, title `"Phase 13.0 — Plan Addendum Pre-flight & Risk Map (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27)"`).
- `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-18.md` (new, from `progress/PROGRESS-TEMPLATE.md`).
- `CHANGELOG.md` (`[Unreleased] — Documentation` entry noting that the addendum and risk map were produced and that implementation has not yet started).

**Verification**:
- `npm ci`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run build`
- `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit`
- `git diff --check`
- Recorded confirmation that no test was weakened or removed (CONSTITUTION §6.3).

**Pause point**: Commit/push via the approved progress-reporting workflow. Halt for explicit user approval of the addendum and the risk map before beginning Step 18.3 (Repository Cleanup).

### 18.3 Phase 13.1 — Repository Cleanup & Re-organization (Safe, Non-Destructive)

**Goal**: Re-organize `src/` (and adjacent assets) into a cleaner, more logical layout, without deleting anything and without changing behavior. This step is executed **first** so that all subsequent feature work in this addendum lands on the cleaned layout.

**Constitutional guardrails** (CONSTITUTION §3, §6.3, §14):
- No file may be deleted.
- No file may be renamed in a way that drops its content.
- No test may be removed, skipped, or weakened.
- Daily 5-letter lock and practice 2–35 contract must remain intact.
- Server-side `api/` build behavior, the `tsconfig.api.json` standalone typecheck, and the "no `@vercel/blob` in client bundle" invariant (Phase 13 of this plan) must remain intact.

**Build / modify** (executed in clearly separated sub-commits so review is feasible):

- **18.3.1 Audit & Move Map (no moves yet).** Produce a concrete move map listing each source path and its proposed new path, grouped by logical concern (e.g., gameplay engine, data layer, UI primitives, account/auth, admin, PWA, stats/progression, definitions, app shell). The move map is committed as part of `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-19.md` so the user can approve it before any file actually moves. The map must:
  - Preserve all module boundaries currently relied on by `api/` and by `tsconfig.api.json`.
  - Preserve the existing barrel re-exports from `src/data/index.ts`, `src/ui/index.ts`, `src/account/index.ts`, and `src/admin/index.ts`.
  - Avoid moving JSON word-list assets unless absolutely required; if moved, the build-time JSON import attributes and the bundled-source path documented in the data layer must be updated atomically.
- **18.3.2 Execute moves in small, reviewable groups.** Each group is a separate commit. For each group:
  - Move files with `git mv` (history-preserving).
  - Update every import path that references the moved file, including TypeScript path aliases (if any are introduced).
  - Update any `__tests__` paths and Vitest configuration that depends on file location.
  - Re-export from existing barrel files so external consumers (including `api/`, `src/App.tsx`, `src/main.tsx`) do not need to change.
- **18.3.3 Update tooling references.** If any move changes paths used by:
  - `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig*.json`, `eslint.config.js`, `vercel.json`, `public/brrrdle-sw.js`, `docs/`, `progress/`, or any GitHub Actions workflow,
  - those references must be updated in the same commit as the move and listed in the corresponding `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md`.

**Key files** (representative; exact list is enumerated by 18.3.1):
- `src/**`
- `api/**` (only import paths if needed; no behavior change)
- `tsconfig.json`, `tsconfig.app.json`, `tsconfig.node.json`, `tsconfig.api.json`
- `vite.config.ts`
- `eslint.config.js`
- `vercel.json`
- `docs/**` (only if a path referenced from docs moves)

**Verification** (run after every sub-commit, recorded in `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-19.md`):
- `npm ci`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test` (full suite, expect identical count and identical pass set; no test may be added or removed in this step except where the test itself moves)
- `npm run build`
- `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit`
- Client-bundle leak check: `grep -R "@vercel/blob" dist/` returns no matches in shipped chunks (Phase 13 invariant).
- `git diff --check`
- `codeql_checker` on the cumulative diff at end of step.

**Manual follow-up steps the user may need to perform** (documented in `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-19.md` and in `CHANGELOG.md`):
- **Vercel**: If `vercel.json` rewrites, the `api/` entry-points, or the cron route path change because of a move, the user must redeploy and re-verify that the Vercel Cron schedule and `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` / `CRON_SECRET` environment variables still bind to the correct routes. If no `api/` path changed, no Vercel reconfiguration is required and this must be stated explicitly.
- **Supabase**: If the Supabase client module path changes (currently `src/account/supabaseClient.ts`), the user does **not** need to reconfigure Supabase project settings — only the local `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` / `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` envs continue to apply. This must be stated explicitly so the user is not misled.
- **GitHub Pages / Jekyll docs**: If any `docs/` file moves, confirm the `_config.yml` `permalink` strategy and any internal cross-links still resolve.
- **GitHub Actions**: If a workflow path expression depends on a moved directory, the workflow file must be updated in the same commit; otherwise, no Actions reconfiguration is required.

**Progress tracking**:
- Append `phase_id = 19`, title `"Phase 13.1 — Repository Cleanup & Re-organization (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27)"` to `progress/PROGRESS.csv`.
- Create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-19.md` with the move map, per-group commit list, verification results, and the explicit manual-follow-up list above.
- Add a `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased] — Changed` entry summarizing only the reorganization at a behavior-preserving level (no new features).

**Pause point**: Commit/push via the approved workflow. Halt for explicit user approval before beginning Step 18.4.

### 18.4 Phase 13.2 — Word Explorer Tab

**Goal**: Add a new public top-level tab that shows the exact word lists the game is currently using, with live filtering, sortable columns, copy buttons, and a pre-filled "Request word" GitHub Issue path.

**Build / modify**:

- **18.4.1 Data hook.** Add a hook that returns, for a chosen length `N` in 2..35, the combined deduplicated union of `answers` ∪ `validGuesses`, tagged with `Type = "Answer"` and/or `Type = "Valid Guess"` (a word that appears in both is tagged as both, per the requirement that the two checkboxes are combinable). The hook must reuse the existing data layer (the same loader used by gameplay) so it inherits the Vercel Blob / manifest → bundled JSON fallback chain. It must not introduce a new fetch path or duplicate the loader.
- **18.4.2 UI.** Add a new route `word-explorer` with:
  - Length selector (default = 5; range = 2..35 inclusive, intersected with `BUNDLED_WORD_LIST_LENGTHS` and any extra lengths the live manifest exposes).
  - Live search box (case-insensitive, exact and prefix-aware; filters incrementally as the user types).
  - Two checkboxes — "Show Answers" and "Show Valid Guesses" — both checked by default and combinable.
  - Sortable column headers ("Word", "Type"). Sort must be deterministic and reversible.
  - Per-row copy-to-clipboard button using the existing UI primitive style (`src/ui/Button.tsx`) and the standard browser clipboard API with a focus-safe fallback.
  - Responsive layout: on small screens the table collapses into a single-column card list (use existing Tailwind utilities; do not introduce a new responsive framework).
  - Empty state: `"{searchTerm}" is not in the current {length}-letter word list.` plus a "Request this word" button.
- **18.4.3 "Request this word" link.** Build a URL to GitHub's pre-filled new-issue endpoint for `ryanjosephkamp/brrrdle` with:
  - Title: `Word request: "{word}" (length {N})`
  - Labels: `word-request`
  - Body: contains the requested word, the selected length, the current date (ISO-8601, generated client-side), a note that the request came from the in-game Word Explorer, and a "Why this word?" optional section with a polite prompt.
  - All URL parameters must be percent-encoded.
  - The link opens in a new tab (`target="_blank"`, `rel="noopener noreferrer"`).
- **18.4.4 Navigation.** Update `src/app/routes.ts` (or its post-cleanup equivalent path from Step 18.3) so the navigation order is exactly: og | go | Practice | **Word Explorer** | **Feedback** | Settings | Admin. The Admin entry must remain hidden for non-admins (CONSTITUTION §8.2).
- **18.4.5 Accessibility & motion.** Keyboard-navigable controls, visible focus rings, ARIA labels on the copy buttons, and respect for `prefers-reduced-motion` (CONSTITUTION §12).
- **18.4.6 Tests.**
  - Unit tests for the combine/dedupe/tag logic at length 5 and at least one short (2 or 3) and one long (≥20) length.
  - Unit tests for the GitHub Issue URL builder, including encoding of words with quotes, apostrophes, and Unicode (where applicable to the bundled set).
  - Unit tests for the empty-state copy and the route ordering.

**Curation note (read-only for this repo)**: The answers curation algorithm in `ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md` §1 Data Source ("Quality score = 0.45×frequency + 0.30×positional + 0.15×vowel-balance + 0.10×uniqueness", dynamic target size, deterministic seed `42 + length`) is owned by the upstream `english-openlist` preprocessing repo, **not** by this repo. The brrrdle app only **consumes** the resulting JSONs and the `metadata` block they contain. This step must document — in the progress report — that no curation algorithm is being implemented inside `brrrdle` and that the metadata block is surfaced verbatim if the live manifest contains it.

**Key files** (paths reflect post-cleanup layout; exact names finalized in Step 18.3):
- New: route file for `WordExplorer`, page component, table component, length selector wrapping the existing primitive (if any), GitHub Issue URL helper, hook.
- Updated: `src/app/routes.ts` (navigation order, route entry), `src/app/App.tsx` (route wiring).
- Updated: barrel `index.ts` files as needed.

**Verification**:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run build`
- Client-bundle leak check unchanged.
- Manual smoke checks, recorded in the progress report:
  - Word Explorer tab is visible while signed-out and while signed-in.
  - Default load is length 5, both checkboxes on, sorted alphabetically.
  - Length 2 and length 35 each show the expected data shape (real or synthetic-placeholder as documented in CHANGELOG, per §17 of this plan).
  - Search filters live and matches are case-insensitive.
  - Sort toggles both directions on both columns.
  - Copy button writes the word to clipboard and announces success without leaking focus.
  - Empty state surfaces the exact `"{searchTerm}" is not in the current {length}-letter word list.` message and the Request button opens a correctly pre-filled GitHub Issue URL (verified by inspecting the URL without actually submitting an issue from the sandbox).
- `codeql_checker` run; any true-positive alert in changed lines fixed.

**Manual follow-up steps**: None expected for Vercel/Supabase. If the GitHub repo `word-request` label does not yet exist on `ryanjosephkamp/brrrdle`, the user must create it once (documented in the progress report).

**Progress tracking**: Append `phase_id = 20`, title `"Phase 13.2 — Word Explorer Tab (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27)"` to `progress/PROGRESS.csv`. Create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-20.md`. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased] — Added` entry.

**Pause point**: Halt for explicit user approval before beginning Step 18.5.

### 18.5 Phase 13.3 — Feedback Tab

**Goal**: Add a new public top-level tab that lets any visitor file a structured feedback item as a pre-filled GitHub Issue.

**Build / modify**:

- New route `feedback`, added to `src/app/routes.ts` between Word Explorer and Settings, preserving the order in Step 18.4.4.
- A simple, accessible form with:
  - **Category** dropdown: `Bug Report` | `Feature Request` | `Other`.
  - **Description** (required, plain text, character ceiling enforced and clearly displayed).
  - **Optional details** (multi-line text).
  - **Optional email** (free-form; not validated against an external service; documented as optional and never required).
  - A "Submit" button that constructs a pre-filled GitHub Issue URL for `ryanjosephkamp/brrrdle`:
    - Title: derived from category + short summary.
    - Labels: `feedback` (plus a category-derived label when straightforward: `bug`, `enhancement`, or none).
    - Body: includes category, description, optional details, optional email, the current date, and a note that the report came from the in-game Feedback tab.
    - URL parameters percent-encoded; link opens in a new tab with `noopener noreferrer`.
- Form must be keyboard-accessible, focus-managed, and respect `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- No server-side endpoint, no client-side email transport, and no PII storage. The optional email is only embedded into the issue body the user reviews before submitting on github.com.

**Tests**:
- Unit tests for the issue-URL builder, including each category and presence/absence of each optional field.
- Unit tests for required-field validation (description cannot be empty/whitespace).
- Snapshot or DOM tests that confirm the form is keyboard-traversable in the documented order.

**Verification**:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run build`
- Manual smoke checks:
  - Feedback tab is visible while signed-out and while signed-in.
  - Each category produces a distinct, correctly-labeled pre-filled URL.
  - Empty description blocks submission with a visible, accessible error.
- `codeql_checker` run; any true-positive alert in changed lines fixed.

**Manual follow-up steps**: If the `feedback` (and optionally `bug`, `enhancement`) labels do not yet exist on `ryanjosephkamp/brrrdle`, the user must create them once. Documented in the progress report.

**Progress tracking**: Append `phase_id = 21`, title `"Phase 13.3 — Feedback Tab (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27)"`. Create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-21.md`. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased] — Added` entry.

**Pause point**: Halt for explicit user approval before beginning Step 18.6.

### 18.6 Phase 13.4 — Sound Effects

**Goal**: Add a minimal, pleasant, fully-toggleable set of sound effects.

**Build / modify**:

- A small sound-effect engine, isolated behind a single module, that exposes named events:
  - `tile-flip`
  - `correct-guess`
  - `game-over-win`
  - `game-over-loss`
  - `keyboard-click`
  - `invalid-guess`
- Implementation must use the **Web Audio API** by default (no media autoplay), with optional small assets in `public/sounds/` if pre-rendered samples are needed. If samples are added, they must be small (<= a few KB each), license-clean, and listed with their provenance in the progress report and CHANGELOG.
- Wire the engine into the existing game flow at the minimum surface area required:
  - `tile-flip` and `keyboard-click` in the keyboard/input layer.
  - `correct-guess`, `invalid-guess`, `game-over-win`, `game-over-loss` in the `og` and `go` session orchestrators.
- Add a **"Sound Effects"** toggle to Settings, **On by default**, persisted via the same local persistence used by other user preferences (no new storage mechanism). The toggle must be honored synchronously by the engine — when off, the engine is a no-op and constructs no `AudioContext`.
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion` if the platform also signals reduced audio (do not couple silently to motion; document the chosen behavior in the progress report).
- The engine must not throw on environments without Web Audio (older browsers, SSR-style preview); it must degrade to a no-op.

**Tests**:
- Unit tests verifying the engine no-ops when the toggle is off.
- Unit tests verifying event names and dispatch ordering (mock the `AudioContext` boundary; do not assert on audible output).
- Unit tests for Settings persistence of the toggle.

**Verification**:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run build`
- Manual smoke checks (on a device with audio):
  - Each of the six events plays at a reasonable volume.
  - Toggling off silences every event immediately.
  - The toggle survives a page reload.
- `codeql_checker` run; any true-positive alert in changed lines fixed.

**Manual follow-up steps**: None for Vercel/Supabase. If new asset files are added under `public/sounds/`, the user must confirm they are committed and that the PWA service worker (`public/brrrdle-sw.js`) cache list includes them or that they are loaded lazily; the chosen behavior is documented in the progress report.

**Progress tracking**: Append `phase_id = 22`, title `"Phase 13.4 — Sound Effects (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27)"`. Create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-22.md`. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased] — Added` entry.

**Pause point**: Halt for explicit user approval before beginning Step 18.7.

### 18.7 Phase 13.5 — Authentication Improvements

**Goal**: Add email + password sign-in alongside the existing magic link flow, persist sessions reliably, and ensure the Admin tab renders fully for users whose Supabase `raw_app_meta_data.role` is `"admin"`.

**Build / modify**:

- **18.7.1 Email + password support in `AuthPanel`.** Add a tabbed or toggle UI inside the existing `AuthPanel` (post-cleanup path) so the user can choose:
  - **Magic link** (existing behavior, unchanged).
  - **Email + password** (new): sign-in and sign-up sub-flows using `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword` and `supabase.auth.signUp`, with clear, accessible error reporting (no raw Supabase error strings shown unfiltered to the user).
- **18.7.2 Session persistence.** Confirm and, where needed, configure the Supabase client (`src/account/supabaseClient.ts`, post-cleanup path) so sessions persist across reloads via the default `persistSession: true` / `autoRefreshToken: true` settings, and so the app subscribes to `onAuthStateChange` exactly once. Do not change the env var names (`VITE_SUPABASE_URL`, `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) and do not introduce any service-role usage on the client (CONSTITUTION §14).
- **18.7.3 Admin role detection.** Confirm and, where needed, fix the front-end to derive admin status from `session.user.app_metadata.role === "admin"` (which maps to Supabase's `raw_app_meta_data.role`). The Admin tab must render with the manual refresh controls already implemented in Phase 8 / Phase 12 work whenever this condition holds. Non-admin users must continue to see the Admin tab hidden.
- **18.7.4 UX & accessibility.** The auth UI must be keyboard-navigable, focus-managed, screen-reader-labeled, and must not autofocus past the first input. Password inputs must use `type="password"` and an optional show/hide toggle; no plaintext logging of passwords or tokens anywhere (CONSTITUTION §14).
- **18.7.5 Backwards compatibility.** Existing magic-link users must not be required to set a password. The two flows must coexist; choosing one must not disable the other for the same email.

**Tests**:
- Unit tests for the new sign-in/sign-up handlers using Supabase client doubles (no live network calls in tests).
- Unit tests for admin detection: a session with `app_metadata.role === "admin"` exposes the Admin tab; a session without it does not; an absent session does not.
- Unit tests that confirm session persistence is enabled (assertion against the constructed client options).
- A regression test that confirms the magic-link path still works through its existing seam.

**Verification**:
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run build`
- `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` (in case any shared type touches the API side)
- Manual smoke checks (recorded in the progress report; live Supabase access required for some):
  - Magic link still works.
  - Email + password sign-up + sign-in works against a Supabase project with password auth enabled.
  - Reload of the page preserves the session.
  - A user whose Supabase `raw_app_meta_data.role` is `"admin"` sees the Admin tab with refresh controls.
  - A non-admin user does not see the Admin tab.
- Static secret-pattern review on changed lines.
- `codeql_checker` run; any true-positive alert in changed lines fixed.

**Manual follow-up steps**:
- **Supabase (required)**: The user must enable **Email + Password** authentication in the Supabase project's Auth providers settings if it is not already enabled. The user must verify that the project's email templates (confirmation, password reset) are configured. These steps cannot be performed by the agent.
- **Supabase (required for admin verification)**: The user must confirm that at least one user has `raw_app_meta_data.role = "admin"` set via the Supabase dashboard or admin API for end-to-end admin verification.
- **Vercel**: No env var changes are expected. If the user previously set any auth-related env vars, this step does not require modifying them; this must be stated explicitly in the progress report.
- **Documentation**: Update `docs/supabase.md` only if user-facing setup instructions for password auth are needed; otherwise leave docs unchanged.

**Progress tracking**: Append `phase_id = 23`, title `"Phase 13.5 — Authentication Improvements (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27)"`. Create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-23.md`. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased] — Changed` and `Added` entries.

**Pause point**: Halt for explicit user approval before beginning Step 18.8.

### 18.8 Phase 13.6 — Final Integration, Cross-Feature Verification, and Release Gate

**Goal**: Confirm that the cleanup, the two new tabs, sound effects, and the auth improvements coexist with each other and with the existing game features without regression.

**Build / modify**: No new functionality. Only fixes for any defect the cross-feature verification surfaces, and final progress/CHANGELOG bookkeeping.

**Verification**:
- `npm ci`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test`
- `npm run build`
- `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit`
- Client-bundle leak check (no `@vercel/blob` in `dist/assets/*.js`).
- `git diff --check`
- Cross-feature manual smoke checks:
  - Daily `og` and daily `go` still play normally with length 5 (the daily lock is intact).
  - Practice mode still exposes lengths 2..35 with the same content guarantees documented in CHANGELOG §17 limitations.
  - Word Explorer tab loads and behaves correctly while signed-out, while signed-in as a non-admin, and while signed-in as an admin.
  - Feedback tab loads and behaves correctly in all three states.
  - Sound effects toggle survives reloads and applies immediately.
  - Sign-in with magic link, sign-in with email + password, session persistence, and admin tab visibility all behave as designed.
  - Sharing, definitions, settings, stats, and the existing admin refresh controls behave unchanged.
- `codeql_checker` run on the cumulative diff for the addendum; any true-positive alert in changed lines fixed.

**Manual follow-up steps (final consolidation)**: Re-list, in the final progress report, every Vercel / Supabase / GitHub-Pages / GitHub-Actions / GitHub-label step the user is required to perform, with checkmarks for those that were completed during the steps above and explicit "user must do" markers for those that remain.

**Progress tracking**: Append `phase_id = 24`, title `"Phase 13.6 — Final Integration & Release Gate (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27)"`. Create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-24.md`. Add a `CHANGELOG.md` consolidating entry.

**Pause point**: Commit/push via the approved workflow. Halt for explicit user approval before any production deployment action.

### 18.9 Phase 13 Exit Checklist

- Every requirement in `ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md` (§1 Word Explorer, §2 Feedback, §3 Sound Effects, §4 Authentication, §5 Cleanup) is implemented or explicitly documented as user-action-required.
- Daily `og` and daily `go` remain locked to 5 letters; practice still exposes 2..35.
- No file was deleted; no test was removed, skipped, or weakened.
- No secrets, service-role keys, or private deployment data appear in any artifact.
- No `@vercel/blob` import is present in the client bundle.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and the standalone `tsconfig.api.json` typecheck all pass.
- `codeql_checker` was run after every step and every true-positive alert in changed lines is fixed.
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, all new `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` reports, and `CHANGELOG.md` are updated and free of sensitive data.
- All manual follow-up steps (Supabase password-auth enablement, label creation on `ryanjosephkamp/brrrdle`, optional Vercel reconfiguration only if any move actually touched a Vercel-bound path) are listed in the final progress report.
- The agent halts and waits for explicit user approval before any production release action.

## 19. Phase 14 — Plan Addendum (DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-ADMIN-TAB-2026-05-27): Fix the Admin Tab

**Plan Version**: 1.4 (addendum)
**Date**: 2026-05-27
**Status**: Draft for user review — implementation must NOT begin until the user explicitly approves this addendum.
**Authority**: This addendum is bound by `CONSTITUTION.md` (v3.1), `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`, all prior sections of this plan, `ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md`, and `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-ADMIN-TAB-2026-05-27.md` (the binding diagnosis report for this addendum).

### 19.1 Scope, Source of Truth, and Operating Rules

This addendum is **scoped strictly** to fixing the Admin tab regression described in `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-ADMIN-TAB-2026-05-27.md`. It does **not** introduce any feature outside that scope.

Binding rules:

- `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-ADMIN-TAB-2026-05-27.md` is the source of truth for the observed behavior and expected behavior; this section is the source of truth for sequencing, verification, and pause points.
- No source file may be deleted or renamed in a lossy way. Every change must be a minimal, additive or in-place edit that preserves all existing behavior outside the admin path.
- The daily 5-letter lock (CONSTITUTION §3, BRRRDLE-SPEC §3.1) and the practice 2..35 contract are out of scope and must remain untouched.
- The Supabase env-var contract is unchanged: only `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` may be read on the client. No service-role key may ever appear on the client (CONSTITUTION §14).
- The existing `/api/admin-refresh` server route, its authorization checks, and its env-var bindings (`SUPABASE_URL` / `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`) must not be weakened. Any client-side call to it must continue to send the user's Supabase access token via `Authorization: Bearer …`.
- Both authentication flows (magic link and email + password) must continue to work after this addendum, and the admin tab must behave correctly under either.
- No test may be removed, skipped, or weakened (CONSTITUTION §6.3).
- The Phase 13 client-bundle leak invariant (`@vercel/blob` must not appear in any `dist/assets/*.js` chunk) must remain intact.
- Every step ends with verification and an explicit halt-for-approval gate (CONSTITUTION §5.3, §6, and Standard Phase Exit Checklist in §1.3).
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv` and a new `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` report must be created/updated for every implementation step below before halting. `CHANGELOG.md` must receive a corresponding `[Unreleased]` entry at every step that ships a user-visible or build-visible change.
- No secrets, tokens, deployment URLs containing internal identifiers, or private deployment data may appear in any artifact (CONSTITUTION §5.4, §14).

### 19.2 Root-Cause Diagnosis

The observed symptom — the Admin tab consistently shows the static copy beginning with `"PROTECTED ADMIN / Manual refresh controls / Manual refresh requests must be sent through the protected /api/admin-refresh server route…"` — is produced by `src/admin/AdminPanel.tsx`. Concretely:

- That copy is the `access.allowed === true` branch of `AdminPanel.tsx`. When the user reports "the Admin tab is still showing only the placeholder text", the user is in fact **already** being recognised as having admin access; the panel simply has no actionable controls rendered inside the allowed branch. The current allowed branch is a descriptive `<Panel>` only — there is no manual refresh button, no status surface, and no call site for `/api/admin-refresh`.
- This is consistent with the diagnosis report's expected behaviour: "the Admin tab must render the full manual refresh UI/controls (the button that calls `/api/admin-refresh`)." Today the controls do not exist on the client. This is the **primary** root cause of the Admin tab regression.

In addition, there are two **secondary** robustness gaps that the diagnosis report explicitly calls out and that this addendum must close so the fix is durable:

- **Role-source coverage.** `src/account/auth.ts → getRoles()` derives admin status by reading `user.app_metadata.roles` (array) and `user.app_metadata.role` (string). In Supabase's JS client `app_metadata` mirrors the database column `raw_app_meta_data`, so in normal operation `app_metadata.role === "admin"` correctly reflects `raw_app_meta_data.role === "admin"`. However, the function does not defensively read `user.raw_app_meta_data?.role` (or `roles`) when present on the returned `User`. In practice this can matter when (a) a future auth-helper or middleware shape exposes the raw column directly, (b) older cached sessions surface only one of the two shapes, or (c) the user inspects the session in the browser console (the diagnostic commands in the diagnosis report) and is misled by an inconsistency between the two shapes. The fix must check **both** shapes and accept admin if either resolves to `"admin"`.
- **Stale session after login.** `App.tsx` subscribes to `onAuthStateChange` exactly once and hydrates `authState` from `getCurrentAuthState()` on mount. That is correct, but immediately after a successful magic-link or email + password sign-in (or sign-up confirmation), the access token in memory still embeds the role claim from the moment the JWT was issued. If the Supabase admin role was granted **after** the JWT was minted, the cached `User` will not yet reflect `role === "admin"` until the next auto-refresh. The fix must explicitly call `supabase.auth.refreshSession()` after a successful sign-in / sign-up (and on the `SIGNED_IN` / `TOKEN_REFRESHED` / `USER_UPDATED` events) so the next role read sees the freshest claim, and the Admin tab updates immediately on first login.

### 19.3 Scope of Fix (summary)

In one minimal, focused phase the agent will:

1. **Render the actual manual-refresh controls** inside `AdminPanel.tsx`'s allowed branch: a single "Refresh now" button that POSTs to `/api/admin-refresh` with `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`, an accessible status region for the in-flight / success / failure states, and a small read-out of the last refresh response (revision, generatedAt, fetchedAt, per-length summary, persistence status) so admins can verify it ran. The descriptive paragraphs already in the allowed branch must be **kept** (no deletions) and merely complemented by the new controls.
2. **Harden admin-role detection** in `src/account/auth.ts` so that admin is granted when **any** of the following resolves to `"admin"`:
   - `user.app_metadata.roles[]` contains `"admin"`,
   - `user.app_metadata.role === "admin"`,
   - `user.raw_app_meta_data?.roles[]` contains `"admin"` (defensive read; `raw_app_meta_data` is not part of the published `User` type but may be present at runtime),
   - `user.raw_app_meta_data?.role === "admin"` (defensive read).
   The function must remain pure, must continue to return `readonly string[]`, must preserve the array-vs-string preference, and must never throw on missing/null shapes.
3. **Force a session refresh after successful sign-in / sign-up** so the Admin tab updates immediately:
   - After a successful `signInWithPassword`, `signUpWithPassword`, and on the `SIGNED_IN`, `TOKEN_REFRESHED`, and `USER_UPDATED` events delivered through `onAuthStateChange`, call `supabase.auth.refreshSession()` once and re-derive `authState` from the refreshed user. The magic-link flow already redirects through Supabase and arrives at `SIGNED_IN`, so the same `onAuthStateChange` path covers it.
   - The refresh must be best-effort: failures must not log the user out, must not throw to the UI, and must be reported through the existing `subscribeToAuthChanges` listener path only.
4. **Cover both auth flows** (magic link and email + password) by the same `onAuthStateChange` plumbing so no flow-specific code is needed.
5. **Keep the change non-breaking**: no file deletion, no file rename, no removal of existing behavior, no test removal. The current Phase 13 `subscribeToAuthChanges` contract and `App.tsx` admin-tab visibility predicate (`authState.user?.roles.includes('admin')`) continue to work unchanged.

Explicitly **out of scope**: Word Explorer, Feedback tab, Sound Effects, Repository Cleanup, OG/GO gameplay, daily lock, practice lengths, definitions, sharing, PWA, Supabase RLS changes, server-route behavior changes.

### 19.4 Phase 14.0 — Pre-flight & Reproduction Map

**Goal**: Confirm a clean baseline and record the exact failure surface before any edit.

**Build / modify**: No source changes. Produce only progress artifacts.

**Activities**:

- Run the baseline verification commands listed in §19.6 against the current `main` and record their results in `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-20.md`.
- Read `src/admin/AdminPanel.tsx`, `src/admin/authorization.ts`, `src/account/auth.ts`, `src/account/AuthPanel.tsx`, `src/account/supabaseClient.ts`, and `src/app/App.tsx` and confirm the current code paths match the diagnosis in §19.2. Record any deltas in the progress report.
- Confirm `supabaseClient.ts` already constructs the client with `persistSession: true` and `autoRefreshToken: true`; if it does not, record that as a blocker for §19.5.3. Do not change it yet.
- Confirm `/api/admin-refresh` continues to read the bearer token and check `app_metadata.role`/`roles` for `"admin"`. If it does, no server change is required by this addendum.
- Record the planned change list (§19.5.1–§19.5.4) and the user-action follow-ups (§19.7) in the progress report.

**Verification**: §19.6 baseline list.

**Pause point**: Halt for explicit user approval before beginning Step 19.5.

### 19.5 Phase 14.1 — Fix the Admin Tab (minimal, surgical)

**Goal**: Implement the four-part fix described in §19.3 with the smallest, safest diff that closes the regression.

**Build / modify** (in clearly separated sub-commits so review is feasible):

- **19.5.1 Harden role detection** (`src/account/auth.ts`).
  - Extend `getRoles(user)` to also defensively read `user.raw_app_meta_data?.roles` (when an array of strings) and `user.raw_app_meta_data?.role` (when a string), in that priority order after the existing `app_metadata` reads, deduplicated. Treat `raw_app_meta_data` as an unknown record (no `User` type widening) and use a narrow runtime guard so the published `@supabase/supabase-js` `User` type does not need to change.
  - Add an explicit `isAdminUser(user)` helper that returns `true` iff any of the four checks in §19.3.2 resolves to `"admin"`. Use it from `summarizeUser` so `AuthUserSummary.roles` continues to be the single source the UI consults.
  - Preserve the existing function signatures, return types (`readonly string[]`), and behavior for non-admin users. Do not introduce new exports beyond `isAdminUser`.

- **19.5.2 Render the manual refresh controls** (`src/admin/AdminPanel.tsx`, `src/admin/index.ts`, new `src/admin/manualRefresh.ts`, new `src/admin/ManualRefreshControls.tsx`).
  - Add `src/admin/manualRefresh.ts` exporting a pure async client helper `requestAdminRefresh({ supabase })` that:
    - Reads the current session via `supabase.auth.getSession()`,
    - Returns `{ ok: false, reason: 'missing-session' }` when there is no session,
    - POSTs to `/api/admin-refresh` with `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>` and `accept: application/json`, no body,
    - Parses the JSON response and returns a discriminated union: `{ ok: true, payload: AdminRefreshSuccess }` for HTTP 202, otherwise `{ ok: false, reason: 'unauthorized' | 'forbidden' | 'server-error' | 'network-error', status?: number, message?: string }`,
    - Never logs the bearer token; never persists the response payload to `localStorage`; never calls `console.error` with the token in scope.
  - Add `src/admin/ManualRefreshControls.tsx` rendering, inside the existing allowed-branch `<Panel>` (without removing the existing paragraphs):
    - A primary `<Button>` labeled "Refresh now" wired to `requestAdminRefresh`,
    - An accessible `aria-live="polite"` status region that shows idle / in-flight / success / failure states,
    - A read-out of the last successful response (revision, generatedAt, fetchedAt, length count, persistence.status) and, on failure, the diagnostic stage and message,
    - Disabled state while a request is in flight and after a successful refresh until the user re-arms (to avoid accidental double-refresh).
  - Update `AdminPanel.tsx` to render `ManualRefreshControls` inside the allowed branch in addition to the existing descriptive paragraphs. The existing `ErrorState` branches for `missing-authentication`, `missing-admin-role`, and `unconfigured` are unchanged. Re-export `ManualRefreshControls` from `src/admin/index.ts`.
  - The new component must accept the Supabase client via prop (not via a module-level import) so it remains testable with a client double, mirrors the pattern used elsewhere in `src/account/`, and supports the `unconfigured` case without crashing.

- **19.5.3 Force fresh session after auth events** (`src/account/auth.ts`, `src/account/AuthPanel.tsx`, `src/app/App.tsx`).
  - In `signInWithPassword` and `signUpWithPassword`, after a successful Supabase call, invoke `await client.auth.refreshSession()` (best-effort: ignore errors, do not surface to the UI, do not log tokens). Return the existing `{ ok: true }` shape unchanged so callers do not need to change.
  - In `subscribeToAuthChanges`, on `SIGNED_IN`, `TOKEN_REFRESHED`, and `USER_UPDATED` events, re-derive the listener payload from `session.user` (already happens) **and** opportunistically call `getCurrentAuthState(client)` after a fresh `getUser()` to pick up server-side role updates that the cached JWT may not yet reflect. Debounce so we never issue more than one `getUser()` per event.
  - In `App.tsx`, no new effects are required; the existing single `useEffect` that subscribes to `subscribeToAuthChanges` will receive the refreshed state through the same listener and re-render the navigation and Admin tab automatically. Verify by trace, not by adding code.
  - Do not call `refreshSession()` for the magic-link send path (`sendMagicLink`); the magic-link redirect arrives at `SIGNED_IN` and the listener path covers it.

- **19.5.4 Tests** (new or extended, no removals):
  - `src/account/auth.test.ts` — add cases for `isAdminUser` / `summarizeUser` covering all four shapes in §19.3.2 (including `raw_app_meta_data.role` only, `raw_app_meta_data.roles` only, `app_metadata.role` only, `app_metadata.roles` only, and combinations); cases for `signInWithPassword` / `signUpWithPassword` confirming that `refreshSession` is invoked on success and **not** invoked on failure; case confirming the refresh failure is swallowed and does not change the returned `{ ok: true }` shape.
  - `src/admin/authorization.test.ts` — add cases confirming the allowed/denied branches are unchanged for the new role-source shapes (the test continues to drive `evaluateAdminAccess` through `AuthState`, not through raw `User`).
  - New `src/admin/manualRefresh.test.ts` — cases for `requestAdminRefresh`: missing session, 401, 403, 502, network failure, and 202 success; assert that the `Authorization` header carries `Bearer <token>` and that the token never appears in the returned payload.
  - New `src/admin/ManualRefreshControls.test.tsx` — render the component with a Supabase client double and a fetch double; assert idle → in-flight → success and idle → in-flight → failure transitions; assert that the status region is `aria-live="polite"`; assert that the button is disabled during the request; assert that the existing descriptive paragraphs continue to render alongside the new controls (proving no deletion).
  - All other existing tests must continue to pass unmodified.

**Key files**:

- Modified: `src/account/auth.ts`, `src/account/auth.test.ts`, `src/admin/AdminPanel.tsx`, `src/admin/authorization.test.ts`, `src/admin/index.ts`.
- New: `src/admin/manualRefresh.ts`, `src/admin/manualRefresh.test.ts`, `src/admin/ManualRefreshControls.tsx`, `src/admin/ManualRefreshControls.test.tsx`.
- Unchanged (verified by inspection, not edit): `src/account/AuthPanel.tsx` body (no UI change), `src/account/supabaseClient.ts` (already persists session / auto-refreshes token), `api/admin-refresh.ts` (server contract unchanged), `src/app/App.tsx` admin-tab visibility predicate.

### 19.6 Verification

After **every** sub-commit in §19.5 and one final time at the end of the phase, the agent must run and record:

- `npm ci`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run test` — full suite must pass with **strictly more** tests than before (new tests added, no tests removed or skipped).
- `npm run build` — `tsc -b` + `vite build` must succeed with no new TypeScript errors. The pre-existing >500 kB chunk-size warning may remain unchanged.
- `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` — must succeed.
- Client-bundle leak check: `grep -R "@vercel/blob" dist/assets/*.js` returns no matches.
- `git diff --check` — clean.
- `codeql_checker` — run on the cumulative diff at the end of the phase; every true-positive alert in changed lines must be fixed before halting.

**Diagnostic console commands** (to be executed manually by the user in the deployed app, recorded in the progress report verbatim, exactly as listed in `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-ADMIN-TAB-2026-05-27.md`):

```js
// 1. Check current user role
supabase.auth.getUser().then(({ data }) => {
  console.log("Full user:", data.user);
  console.log("app_metadata.role:", data.user?.app_metadata?.role);
  console.log("raw_app_meta_data.role:", data.user?.raw_app_meta_data?.role);
  console.log("Is admin?", data.user?.raw_app_meta_data?.role === "admin");
});

// 2. Check if Admin tab should be visible
console.log("Current session:", supabase.auth.getSession());
```

**Manual smoke checks** (recorded in `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-20.md`):

- Sign in via magic link as a Supabase user with `raw_app_meta_data.role = "admin"`. The Admin tab becomes visible in the primary navigation **without a manual page reload** within one auth event, and shows both the existing descriptive paragraphs **and** the new "Refresh now" button.
- Repeat with email + password sign-in. Same expected result.
- Repeat with email + password sign-up for a brand-new user that the operator promotes to admin in the Supabase dashboard **after** sign-up; on the next `TOKEN_REFRESHED` (or after the operator triggers `Refresh now` once, or after the operator signs out and back in), the Admin tab appears.
- Sign in as a non-admin user. The Admin tab remains hidden from the primary navigation, and the `evaluateAdminAccess`-driven `ErrorState` would show if the route were forced.
- Click "Refresh now" as the admin user. The status region transitions idle → in-flight → success (or → failure with a diagnostic stage/message). The browser DevTools network panel shows a POST to `/api/admin-refresh` with `Authorization: Bearer …`. No service-role key is sent.
- Reload the page after sign-in. The session persists, the Admin tab remains visible, and the refresh button remains operational.

### 19.7 Manual Follow-Up Steps (User-Required)

These steps must be listed verbatim in `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-20.md` and in the `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased] — User action required` block:

- **Supabase (required)**: Confirm that at least one user has `raw_app_meta_data.role = "admin"` set via the Supabase dashboard or admin API. Without this, no smoke check in §19.6 can verify the admin path end-to-end.
- **Supabase (required for email + password verification)**: Confirm the Email + Password provider remains enabled (carried over from the Phase 13.5 follow-up in §18.7).
- **Vercel**: No environment-variable or routing change is required. `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` (or their `VITE_`-prefixed counterparts) must continue to be set on the Vercel project so `/api/admin-refresh` can validate the bearer token.
- **GitHub Actions / Pages / labels**: No action required.
- **Browser session hygiene** (recommended once after deploy): The first time an existing admin user opens the new build, ask them to sign out and sign back in so the locally cached JWT is replaced. This guarantees the `raw_app_meta_data` claim that was minted before the deploy is immediately re-read.

### 19.8 Progress Tracking and CHANGELOG

- Append `phase_id = 20` ("Phase 14.0 — Admin Tab Fix Pre-flight & Reproduction Map") and `phase_id = 21` ("Phase 14.1 — Admin Tab Fix (Implementation & Verification)") to `progress/PROGRESS.csv` as their respective steps are executed.
- Create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-20.md` (for Phase 14.0, pre-flight) and `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-21.md` (for Phase 14.1, implementation) using `progress/PROGRESS-TEMPLATE.md`.
- For the addendum-drafting step itself (this section), append a note to the most recent existing progress report (`progress/PROGRESS-STEP-19.md`) and add an `[Unreleased] — Documentation` entry to `CHANGELOG.md` recording that the addendum has been created and that implementation has not begun.
- For Phase 14.1, add `[Unreleased] — Fixed` and `[Unreleased] — Added` entries to `CHANGELOG.md` describing the admin-tab regression fix, the new manual-refresh controls component, the hardened role detection, and the post-login session refresh.

### 19.9 Phase 14 Exit Checklist

- The Admin tab renders an actionable "Refresh now" button (plus the existing descriptive paragraphs) for users whose Supabase user has `raw_app_meta_data.role === "admin"` (or `app_metadata.role === "admin"`).
- Admin role detection accepts admin from any of `app_metadata.roles[]`, `app_metadata.role`, `raw_app_meta_data.roles[]`, or `raw_app_meta_data.role`.
- The Admin tab updates immediately after sign-in (magic link or email + password) without requiring a manual page reload, via the `onAuthStateChange` listener and an explicit best-effort `refreshSession()` call.
- No file was deleted; no test was removed, skipped, or weakened.
- The daily 5-letter lock and the practice 2..35 contract are unchanged.
- No service-role key is present on the client; `/api/admin-refresh` server contract is unchanged.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` all pass.
- `codeql_checker` was run on the cumulative diff and every true-positive alert in changed lines is fixed.
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-20.md`, `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-21.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` are updated and free of sensitive data.
- The agent halts and waits for explicit user approval before any production release action.

## 20. Phase 15 — Plan Addendum (AUTH-UX-IMPROVEMENTS-SPEC-2026-05-27): Authentication & Profile UX Redesign

**Plan Version**: 1.5 (addendum). Bound by `AUTH-UX-IMPROVEMENTS-SPEC-2026-05-27.md`, `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.1, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, and the prior plan.

### 20.1 Scope, Source of Truth, and Operating Rules

- **Source of truth**: `AUTH-UX-IMPROVEMENTS-SPEC-2026-05-27.md`. Every creative decision is documented here.
- **Non-negotiable preserved invariants**: Daily 5-letter lock and practice 2..35; Admin gating and `/api/admin-refresh` server contract; Word Explorer, Feedback, Sound Effects, sharing, definitions, stats, guest persistence, Pay-to-Continue, sync stub, danger-zone confirmations; no file deletion; no test removal/skip/weakening; no new env var names; no service-role on client; no `@vercel/blob` in client bundle; magic-link and password flows coexist.
- **Architecture (creative)**: Profile data stored in `auth.users.user_metadata` via `supabase.auth.updateUser({ data })`. Avatars default to deterministic initials-on-gradient; image upload is gated on a runtime probe of an `avatars` Supabase Storage bucket.

### 20.2 Phase 15.0 — Pre-flight & Baseline (executed)
Re-confirmed baseline (194/194 tests, lint+build clean). Reproduction map confirmed every Current Problem in the spec is reproducible at HEAD.

### 20.3 Phase 15.1 — Auth Helper Surface Expansion (executed)
- `src/account/profile.ts`: pure helpers `deriveInitials`, `normalizeDisplayName`, `validateAccentColor`, `validateAvatarUrl`, `pickInitialsGradient`, `deriveProfileFromUser`.
- `src/account/auth.ts` additive helpers: `classifyAuthError`, `sendPasswordResetEmail` (renamed from spec's `requestPasswordReset` to avoid colliding with the pre-existing unused `dangerZone.requestPasswordReset`), `updateProfile`, `hasAvatarStorage`, `uploadAvatar`. `AuthUserSummary.profile` derived in `summarizeUser`.

### 20.4 Phase 15.2 — `AuthModal` (executed)
- `src/account/AuthModal.tsx`: Dialog with Magic Link / Email + Password tabs, `role="radiogroup"` sub-mode toggle, single primary CTA, inline Forgot Password flow, `aria-live` status, sanitized errors via `classifyAuthError`, auto-close on `authenticated=true`.

### 20.5 Phase 15.3 — Global `AccountBadge` (executed)
- `src/account/AccountBadge.tsx`: anonymous → Guest pill opening `AuthModal`; unconfigured → quiet "Guest · sync unavailable"; authenticated → avatar + label opening `ProfilePanel`. Mobile-first responsive (avatar-only under `sm`).

### 20.6 Phase 15.4 — `ProfilePanel` (executed)
- `src/account/ProfilePanel.tsx`: display name (≤ 50), accent color radiogroup, optional avatar upload gated on `hasAvatarStorage`. Save → `updateProfile`. Falls back to initials avatar when no bucket exists.

### 20.7 Phase 15.5 — Wiring (executed)
- `src/app/App.tsx` adds modal/profile state, renders `AccountBadge` in `Layout` navigation, renders `AuthModal` + `ProfilePanel` at layout root, re-derives `AuthState` after successful save.
- `src/account/Settings.tsx` adds Sign in / Manage profile buttons; existing `AuthPanel` preserved (no deletion). Duplicate-CTA bug fixed in `AuthPanel` via radiogroup + single primary CTA.
- `src/app/routes.ts` unchanged; profile is a dialog, not a route.

### 20.8 Phase 15.6 — Final Integration & Release Gate (executed)
- Lint, test (256/256), build, API typecheck, leak check all green.
- CodeQL run on changed lines; no true-positive alerts.
- CHANGELOG, PROGRESS.csv, PROGRESS-STEP-22.md, docs/supabase.md additive note all updated.

### 20.9 Phase 15 Exit Checklist
- Every spec requirement (§1, §3.1–§3.5, §4, §5) is implemented or explicitly documented as user-action-required.
- No duplicate primary CTAs in any sign-in/sign-up surface on any viewport.
- Global signed-in / Guest indicator present on every route.
- No raw Supabase error strings reach the UI; all flow through `classifyAuthError`.
- Forgot Password flow works end-to-end against a properly configured Supabase project.
- Profile persists via `auth.users.user_metadata`; optional avatar upload gated on Storage bucket and never breaks the experience when absent.
- Daily 5-letter lock, practice 2..35, Admin gating, `/api/admin-refresh`, and all Phase 13/14 invariants preserved.
- No file/test deletion; no service-role on client; no `@vercel/blob` in client bundle; no new env var names.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` all pass.
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-22.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` updated and free of sensitive data.
- Halt before any production release action.

## 21. Phase 16 — Mobile & Tablet Responsiveness Improvements (Keyboard, Grid, and Touch Scaling)

**Plan Version**: 1.6 (addendum). Bound by `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.1, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, and the prior plan (Phases 0–15). Triggered by a user report that the game grid tiles, on-screen keyboard, and letter sizing do not scale properly on phones and tablets (especially iPads), breaking the app-like feel.

### 21.1 Scope, Source of Truth, and Operating Rules

- **Source of truth for this phase**: this Section 21 of `AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` plus the user request transcribed in §21.2. No new top-level spec document is required; design decisions are documented inline here.
- **Non-negotiable preserved invariants** (carried unchanged from Phases 0–15):
  - Daily `og`/`go` modes locked at 5 letters; practice mode supports lengths 2–35.
  - Admin tab gating via `session.user.app_metadata.role === "admin"` and the `/api/admin-refresh` server contract.
  - Word Explorer, Feedback Tab, Sound Effects, Sharing, definitions stack, stats, guest persistence, Pay-to-Continue economy, sync stub, danger-zone confirmations.
  - Auth flows: magic link, email + password, forgot password, `AuthModal`, `AccountBadge`, `ProfilePanel`, `classifyAuthError`, no raw Supabase error strings in UI.
  - No file deletion, no test removal/skip/weakening, no new env var names, no service-role on client, no `@vercel/blob` in client bundle.
  - All existing keyboard-input semantics (`useKeyboardInput`, `Keyboard.onInput` contract, `letterStates` coloring) remain byte-identical at the public API level.
- **Operating rules**:
  - Changes are CSS/Tailwind/markup-only inside existing components. No changes to game state, validation, persistence, networking, or auth.
  - Prefer Tailwind responsive utilities, CSS `clamp()`, dynamic viewport units (`dvh`/`svh`/`dvw`), and CSS container queries (`@container` / `cqi`) over JavaScript-measured sizing. Touch JS only when absolutely necessary (e.g., a `useResizeObserver` hook is **not** required for v1 of this phase).
  - No new runtime dependencies. Tailwind v4 already supports container queries and dynamic viewport units natively.
  - Visual changes must be additive: existing class strings may be extended, but no class that another component or test depends on may be removed without a documented replacement.

### 21.2 User Request (verbatim summary)

> The current UI (especially the game grid tiles, on-screen keyboard, and letter sizing) does not scale properly on mobile devices and tablets — particularly iPads. Tiles and keyboard keys become either too large or too small, breaking the app-like feel on smaller and larger touch screens.

### 21.3 Diagnosis of Current Scaling Issues

Findings are based on HEAD as of Plan Version 1.5:

1. **Grid tiles use fixed `min-h-*` with `aspect-square` and CSS Grid `minmax(0, 1fr)` columns** (`src/app/games/OgGame.tsx:80–95`, `src/app/games/GoGame.tsx:80–95`):
   - Classes `flex aspect-square min-h-8 ... sm:min-h-10 sm:text-base` only define a *floor* on tile size, never a ceiling.
   - Because the row is a `grid` with `repeat(N, minmax(0, 1fr))` inside the full-width `<main>` Panel, the tile width is `(panelWidth − gaps) / N`. On iPad portrait (~768 px viewport, panel ~720 px after padding), 5-letter daily rows produce tiles of ~135 px each — visually oversized relative to `text-base` (16 px) letters, breaking the app-like feel.
   - On 35-letter practice rows on a phone, columns shrink below the `min-h-8` (32 px) floor in the *width* dimension while `aspect-square` keeps height ≥ 32 px, producing non-square tiles and overflow risk.
   - Font sizing (`text-sm` / `sm:text-base`) is decoupled from tile size — letters stay tiny while tiles bloom on tablets, or letters look cramped on phones with long practice words.

2. **On-screen keyboard keys use fixed `min-h-11 ... sm:min-h-12` and `text-sm`** (`src/ui/Keyboard.tsx:38, 55, 57`):
   - The widest row is `qwertyuiop` (10 keys) plus `flex justify-center gap-1.5 sm:gap-2`. On a 320 px phone in portrait, 10 keys + 9 gaps + outer padding leave ~26 px per key — visually cramped and below the WCAG 24 px / Apple HIG 44 pt touch-target guidance once `px-2` padding is consumed.
   - On iPad portrait, the same row consumes only ~520 px of a 720 px panel, producing a centered floating bar that looks under-sized relative to the grid above.
   - The bottom row Enter/Del buttons use a smaller `text-xs` than the letter keys; on tablets this becomes visually inconsistent.

3. **Outer Layout shell does not adapt to mobile viewport realities** (`src/ui/Layout.tsx:14–32`):
   - `min-h-svh` is used (good), but inner padding `px-4 py-6 sm:px-6 lg:px-8` is symmetric and ignores iOS safe-area insets, so on notched devices the AccountBadge and grid edge under the status bar / home indicator in standalone PWA mode.
   - `index.html` viewport tag (`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />`, `index.html:11`) lacks `viewport-fit=cover`, which is a precondition for `env(safe-area-inset-*)` to take effect.

4. **No use of CSS container queries**:
   - Tile and key sizes are driven by viewport breakpoints (`sm:`, `lg:`), not by the size of the panel/section they actually live in. The header Panel takes ~25 % of vertical space on phones, but the grid sizes itself off viewport width regardless of how much space the header consumes. On iPad split-view (e.g., 50 % width) the grid is treated as a phone because viewport width is small, even though container width is generous.

5. **No dynamic viewport height handling for mobile browser chrome**:
   - `min-h-svh` correctly accounts for the small viewport, but no element uses `dvh` (dynamic viewport height) for the playable area, so when the URL bar collapses there is a visible gap below the keyboard in Safari iOS.

### 21.4 Proposed Solution (clean, minimal, non-breaking)

The fix is delivered as a single new phase with five small steps. All changes are additive Tailwind class extensions and CSS variable definitions; no component contracts change.

**Design principles**:
- Use **CSS `clamp()`** to define a tile and key size with explicit floor, fluid middle (driven by container-query inline units `cqi` where supported, viewport units `vw` otherwise), and ceiling.
- Use **CSS container queries** on the grid section and keyboard section so sizing follows the actual panel width, not the raw viewport.
- Use **dynamic viewport units** (`dvh`, `svh`) on the app shell and `safe-area-inset-*` padding for iOS standalone PWA polish.
- Use **explicit Tailwind breakpoints** (`sm` 640, `md` 768, `lg` 1024, `xl` 1280) for coarse adjustments, with `clamp()`/container queries doing the fluid work in between.
- Tie **letter font-size to tile size** (and key font-size to key size) via `cqi` or `em` so glyphs grow and shrink together with their container.

**Step 21.4.1 — Establish design tokens for tile and key sizing**

- Add CSS variables in `src/index.css` (or a small `src/styles/responsive.css` imported from `src/index.css`):
  - `--brrrdle-tile-min`, `--brrrdle-tile-ideal`, `--brrrdle-tile-max` (e.g., `2rem`, `clamp(2rem, 8cqi, 4.25rem)`, `4.25rem`).
  - `--brrrdle-key-min`, `--brrrdle-key-ideal`, `--brrrdle-key-max` (e.g., `2.25rem`, `clamp(2.25rem, 9cqi, 3.75rem)`, `3.75rem`).
  - `--brrrdle-tile-font` and `--brrrdle-key-font` expressed as `cqi`/`em` of the tile/key.
- Defaults must reproduce current desktop appearance at ≥ `lg` viewports so no regression occurs on existing screens.

**Step 21.4.2 — Make the grid section a CSS container and apply container-query sizing**

- In `src/app/games/OgGame.tsx` and `src/app/games/GoGame.tsx`, wrap the existing `<div role="grid">` (or its parent) with a Tailwind container-query parent (`@container` / `class="@container"` via the Tailwind v4 built-in `container-type: inline-size` utility).
- Replace the tile className:
  - From: `flex aspect-square min-h-8 ... sm:min-h-10 sm:text-base`
  - To (semantically): `flex aspect-square items-center justify-center rounded-xl border shadow-inner shadow-slate-950/20 font-black uppercase` plus inline `style={{ fontSize: 'clamp(0.875rem, 6cqi, 1.5rem)' }}` (or a Tailwind arbitrary value).
- Cap the entire row's max width with `style={{ maxWidth: 'min(100%, calc(var(--brrrdle-tile-max) * N + gap * (N-1)))' }}` so 5-letter daily rows on iPads stop ballooning past ~340 px while 35-letter practice rows still occupy full width on phones.
- Center the row with `mx-auto` so capped rows remain visually balanced.

**Step 21.4.3 — Responsive on-screen keyboard**

- In `src/ui/Keyboard.tsx`, wrap the `<section>` with `@container` and key sizing driven by `cqi`:
  - Replace `min-h-11 ... sm:min-h-12` with `min-h-[2.25rem] @md:min-h-[2.75rem] @lg:min-h-[3.25rem]` plus inline `style={{ fontSize: 'clamp(0.75rem, 4.25cqi, 1.05rem)', minWidth: 'clamp(1.75rem, 8.5cqi, 2.75rem)' }}`.
  - Set Enter/Del to `style={{ minWidth: 'clamp(2.5rem, 12cqi, 4.25rem)' }}` and use `text-[clamp(0.625rem,3.5cqi,0.95rem)]` so they scale with letter keys instead of staying at a fixed `text-xs`.
- Preserve the 44 px Apple HIG touch-target floor by clamping `min-h` ≥ `2.25rem` (36 px logical; ≥ 44 px once tapped area + padding considered) and adding `touch-action: manipulation` to prevent iOS double-tap zoom on rapid letter entry.
- On `@sm`-and-narrower containers, reduce gap from `gap-1.5` to `gap-1` and reduce horizontal padding so 10 keys always fit one row at ≥ 320 px viewport.

**Step 21.4.4 — App-shell and viewport polish**

- Update `index.html:11` viewport tag to `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover" />`.
- In `src/ui/Layout.tsx`:
  - Add safe-area padding: `pt-[max(1.5rem,env(safe-area-inset-top))] pb-[max(1.5rem,env(safe-area-inset-bottom))]` and equivalent left/right for landscape on notched devices.
  - Switch the shell to `min-h-dvh` (with `min-h-svh` retained as fallback for older Safari via the existing `min-h-svh` class — Tailwind v4 emits the `dvh` variant cleanly).
  - On `@md`-and-up containers, consider a two-column layout where the keyboard sits to the side on landscape tablets/desktops (optional polish; only if it keeps the app-like feel — see §21.4.5).

**Step 21.4.5 — Tasteful creative polish (optional within this phase)**

- Sticky keyboard on phone portrait: on `< @md` containers, keyboard becomes `sticky bottom-0` with a subtle backdrop-blur, ensuring it never scrolls out of reach during practice with long words and a tall grid.
- Subtle haptic-style press animation (`active:scale-95 transition-transform`) on keyboard buttons for mobile app-feel. Respect `motion-reduce` users (`motion-safe:` prefix).
- Grid row "shake" and tile "reveal" animations already exist and remain unchanged.
- iPad portrait: introduce a comfortable `max-w-md` cap on the keyboard so it visually mirrors the capped 5-letter daily grid above instead of stretching to the full panel.

### 21.5 Phase 16 — Sub-Phase Plan

| Sub-phase | Title | Files Touched (planned) | Verification |
|-----------|-------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 16.0 | Pre-flight & responsive baseline capture | none (read-only) | Re-confirm 256/256 tests pass; capture before-screenshots at iPhone SE (375×667), iPhone 14 Pro (393×852), iPad mini portrait (744×1133), iPad Pro 11" portrait (834×1194), iPad Pro 11" landscape (1194×834), and desktop (1440×900) — used only as agent notes, not committed |
| 16.1 | Design tokens & viewport polish | `index.html`, `src/index.css` (+/- a new `src/styles/responsive.css`), `src/ui/Layout.tsx` | `npm run lint`, `npm run build`, visual sanity check |
| 16.2 | Responsive grid tiles | `src/app/games/OgGame.tsx`, `src/app/games/GoGame.tsx` | `npm run test` (existing grid tests must remain green), `npm run build` |
| 16.3 | Responsive on-screen keyboard | `src/ui/Keyboard.tsx` | `npm run test` (keyboard tests remain green), `npm run build` |
| 16.4 | Optional polish (sticky keyboard, press animation, iPad keyboard cap) | `src/ui/Keyboard.tsx`, `src/app/games/OgGame.tsx`, `src/app/games/GoGame.tsx` (markup only) | `npm run test`, `npm run build` |
| 16.5 | Final integration, cross-feature verification, and release gate | docs/changelog/progress only | full pipeline (see §21.6) |

Each sub-phase ends with a `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` and a `progress/PROGRESS.csv` row appended for the corresponding `phase_id` (next available IDs after Phase 15's last). The agent halts at every sub-phase gate per CONSTITUTION.md §1.3 unless the user explicitly authorizes contiguous execution.

### 21.6 Verification & Release Gate (Phase 16.5)

Required to pass before declaring Phase 16 complete:

1. `npm run lint` — clean.
2. `npm run test` — all existing tests (currently 256) pass with zero new failures. Add at least one new render test per modified component asserting the presence of the new responsive class tokens (no new `data-testid`s introduced gratuitously).
3. `npm run build` — clean; no new bundle-size regressions beyond a small CSS delta.
4. `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` — clean.
5. Client-bundle leak check: `grep -R "@vercel/blob" dist/` returns no matches (Phase 13 invariant).
6. Manual visual verification at the six viewports listed in §21.5 Phase 16.0. Grid tiles must:
   - Remain visually square at every breakpoint.
   - Cap at ~`4.25rem` per side on 5-letter daily rows on iPad portrait and wider.
   - Scale font-size with tile size so the letter always fills ~55–65 % of the tile height.
7. Keyboard must:
   - Fit 10 keys + gaps within a 320 px viewport without horizontal scroll.
   - Show ≥ 44 px effective touch targets on phones.
   - Not exceed `max-w-md`-equivalent on iPad portrait so it visually mirrors the capped grid.
8. CodeQL run on changed lines after Phase 16.4; any true-positive alerts must be fixed before Phase 16.5 closes.

### 21.7 Preserved Invariants (Phase 16-specific re-statement)

- Daily 5-letter lock and practice 2..35 — unchanged; grid still uses `repeat(${session.wordLength}, minmax(0, 1fr))`.
- Admin tab — purely a navigation/visibility concern; not touched.
- Word Explorer, Feedback, Sound Effects, Auth flows (`AuthModal`, `AccountBadge`, `ProfilePanel`, `classifyAuthError`, magic-link + password coexistence) — markup may receive responsive class additions only; component contracts unchanged.
- Pay-to-Continue economy, sharing, definitions, stats, guest persistence, sync stub — untouched.
- No file deletion, no test removal/skip/weakening.
- No new env vars, no service-role on client, no `@vercel/blob` in client bundle.
- No new runtime dependency.

### 21.8 Progress Tracking and CHANGELOG

- Append rows to `progress/PROGRESS.csv` for each of Phases 16.0 through 16.5, using the next contiguous `phase_id` values after the highest currently recorded ID. Titles follow the pattern `"Phase 16.x — <Sub-phase title>"`.
- Create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` from `progress/PROGRESS-TEMPLATE.md` for each sub-phase, summarising what changed, verification results, blockers, and explicit go/no-go for the next sub-phase.
- Add `[Unreleased] — Changed` and `[Unreleased] — Added` entries to `CHANGELOG.md` for: responsive design tokens, container-query-driven grid sizing, responsive on-screen keyboard, iOS safe-area / viewport-fit polish, and any optional polish actually shipped.

### 21.9 Phase 16 Exit Checklist

- All §21.3 diagnoses are demonstrably resolved on the six reference viewports.
- All §21.7 invariants verified intact.
- All Phase 16.6 verification items (§21.6) green.
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-*.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` updated and free of sensitive data.
- Halt for explicit user approval before any production release action.

## 22. Phase 17 — Use Local brrrdle Word List JSONs from `src/latest/` (Addendum, LOCAL-WORD-LISTS-SPEC-2026-05-28)

**Plan Version**: 1.7 (addendum). Bound by `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.1, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, the prior plan (Phases 0–16), and `LOCAL-WORD-LISTS-SPEC-2026-05-28.md` (the source of truth for this phase). Triggered by the user manually placing the latest 34 authoritative per-length JSON dictionaries inside the repository and reporting that the runtime Hugging Face fetch is failing and producing "word not in list" errors and incomplete practice lengths.

> Status: **No code changes yet.** This addendum exists for user review. Implementation is gated on explicit user approval (see §22.10).

### 22.1 Scope, Source of Truth, and Operating Rules

- **Source of truth for this phase**: `LOCAL-WORD-LISTS-SPEC-2026-05-28.md` and this Section 22. If the spec and prior phases conflict, the spec wins for the narrow concerns of (a) where the word data is read from and (b) deprecation of the runtime Hugging Face path for normal gameplay. All other invariants from Phases 0–16 are preserved.
- **Authoritative on-disk path discrepancy (must reconcile during 17.1)**:
  - The spec text refers to `src/latest/brrrdle/`.
  - The repository as committed places the 34 files directly at `src/latest/` (verified at HEAD: `src/latest/words_length_2.json` … `src/latest/words_length_35.json`, plus `manifest.json`, `README.md`, and transitional `brrrdle_words.json` / `brrrdle_words.txt` length-5 compatibility files).
  - Treat the actual on-disk location (`src/latest/`) as authoritative for code. Mention the spec's `src/latest/brrrdle/` wording in `CHANGELOG.md` and Phase 17 progress notes so the discrepancy is auditable. If the user prefers, a one-time `git mv` to `src/latest/brrrdle/` may be performed during Sub-phase 17.1 as a pure rename; the loader path constant is the single point that decides which layout is in effect.
- **Non-negotiable preserved invariants** (carried unchanged from Phases 0–16):
  - Daily `og`/`go` locked at 5 letters; practice 2–35.
  - Admin tab + `/api/admin-refresh` server contract intact; the refresh endpoint and Phase 14 admin authorization remain in place as an optional override only.
  - Word Explorer, Feedback tab, Sound Effects, Sharing, Pay-to-Continue economy, Auth flows, stats, definitions stack, mobile/tablet responsiveness — all untouched.
  - Public APIs of the data layer remain byte-identical at the signature level: `loadBundledWordList`, `getWordRepository`, `getRequestedWordLength`, `getAnswerCandidates`, `getValidGuesses`, `getDefinitionsForWord`, `validateGuess`, and barrel exports in `src/data/index.ts`.
  - `NormalizedWordList`, `WordEntry`, `WordDefinitionEntry`, `WordListFile`, `WordListMetadata`, and `RemoteWordListMetadata` types remain backward-compatible. Any change is additive (optional fields only).
  - No file deletion. No removal/skip/weakening of existing tests. No new env vars. No service-role on client. No `@vercel/blob` in client bundle. No new runtime dependency. No change to `MIN_PRACTICE_WORD_LENGTH=2` / `MAX_PRACTICE_WORD_LENGTH=35` / `DAILY_WORD_LENGTH=5`.
- **Operating rules**:
  - Strictly minimal, non-breaking changes.
  - The runtime Hugging Face fetch is **deprecated, not deleted**. `src/data/huggingFaceSource.ts`, `src/data/refresh.ts`, `src/data/refreshStore.ts`, `src/data/updateCheck.ts`, and `api/admin-refresh.ts` continue to compile, pass existing tests, and remain reachable from the protected admin route. Only the **default loading path used by gameplay** moves to local JSON.
  - Use static `import` of the 34 local JSON files via Vite's JSON loader (mirroring the existing pattern in `src/data/wordLists.ts`). No new dependency is required.
  - All data-layer error reasons and result shapes (`unsupported-length`, `daily-length-locked`, `missing-bundled-list`, `invalid-bundled-list`) remain unchanged. A new failure surface is permitted only if additive (e.g., `'invalid-local-list'`) and only if absolutely required — preferred is to reuse `'invalid-bundled-list'` so consumers don't have to change.

### 22.2 Diagnosis of the Current Remote-Fetch Problem

Findings against HEAD (Plan Version 1.6):

1. **The bundled snapshot under `src/data/bundled/` is the 2026-05-26 development seed, not the real 2026-05-28 dataset.**
   - `src/data/bundled/source.json` self-identifies as `version: bundle-2026-05-26` with `lengths: [2, 5, 35]` and the note "Bundled development seed. The first successful scheduled or admin refresh … will replace this snapshot".
   - The seed is sparse for many lengths (e.g., length 5 `answers` includes the curated `{ word: "crane", definitions: […] }` object followed by a handful of plain strings), so practice modes for lengths outside 2/5/35 fall back to thin lists and reject common words as "not in list".
2. **The runtime path that was supposed to upgrade the seed is the Hugging Face refresh** (`src/data/huggingFaceSource.ts` + `src/data/refresh.ts`, swapped in by `refreshStore.ts` and triggered by the daily Vercel Cron and `/api/admin-refresh`). The user reports this is failing in the current environment, leaving gameplay on the seed permanently.
3. **The user has now committed the real authoritative data into the repo at `src/latest/`** (34 files, lengths 2–35, generated at `2026-05-28T01:39:10.899912+00:00`, schema version `2.0`, per-length counts ranging from 134 at length 2 to 47,763 at length 9). Per-length `answers` is a curated array of plain strings produced by `stratified_quality_score_v1`; `validGuesses` is the full per-length list.
4. **Schema gap**: the new files do **not** match the current `WordListMetadata` schema validator:
   - `metadata` contains only a `curation` block (no `length`, `source`, `version`, `generatedAt` strings).
   - `answers` is `string[]` (no inline `definitions`). The existing `validateWordEntry` already accepts strings, so this half is compatible.
   - `validGuesses` is `string[]` — already compatible.
   - Without an adjustment to `validateWordListFile` (or a new local-list adapter), every local file would be rejected with `invalid-bundled-list` and four "metadata required" issues.
5. **Definitions consequence**: the new per-length files do not carry inline `definitions`. The post-game Definitions System (Phase 6) already falls back through Dictionary API → Wiktionary → Google search, so eliminating inline definitions for the curated subset is acceptable — but the addendum must explicitly confirm this and the verification matrix must re-cover §6.

### 22.3 Proposed Solution (minimal, non-breaking)

The fix is delivered as **one logical change**: add a thin "local source" path that statically imports the 34 JSONs from `src/latest/` and feeds them into the existing normalization pipeline, then make `BUNDLED_WORD_LISTS` resolve from the local source by default. Everything downstream is unchanged.

**Design choices**:

- **Single new file, single edit point**: introduce `src/data/localWordLists.ts` containing 34 static JSON imports (mirroring `src/data/wordLists.ts`) plus a `LOCAL_WORD_LISTS` record. This keeps the diff cohesive and reviewable. `src/data/wordLists.ts` becomes a thin re-export of `LOCAL_WORD_LISTS` aliased as `BUNDLED_WORD_LISTS`, preserving the existing import name used by `loadBundledWordList`.
- **Adapter, not schema rewrite**: add a `normalizeLocalWordListFile(raw, length): WordListFile` adapter that:
  - Synthesizes the legacy `WordListMetadata` block from the manifest + per-length file (e.g., `length: N`, `source: 'src/latest (english-openlist-brrrdle 2026-05-28)'`, `version: '<release_date from manifest.json>'`, `generatedAt: '<generated_at from manifest.json>'`).
  - Passes the raw `metadata.curation` block through on an additive, optional `curation?` field added to `WordListMetadata` (additive only — existing consumers ignore unknown fields).
  - Leaves `answers` and `validGuesses` as-is (strings), letting the existing `validateWordListFile` continue to do the heavy validation.
- **No change to `loadBundledWordList`'s public surface**: it still calls `validateWordListFile(bundled)` and returns `LoadWordListResult`. The adapter runs **before** `validateWordListFile`, so any malformed local file is still caught by the canonical schema validator and surfaces as `invalid-bundled-list`.
- **Curated answers subset (BRRRDLE-ANSWERS-CURATION-SPEC) is preserved automatically**: the local files already encode the curated subset in `answers` — the loader does not need to re-curate.
- **Definitions**: `definitionsByWord` becomes an empty Map for the local-source path. The Definitions System already handles "no inline definition" gracefully via the Dictionary API → Wiktionary → Google fallback chain. No UI change.
- **Daily-mode performance**: static imports of all 34 files are no slower than the existing `src/data/bundled/` pattern. To safeguard daily mode bundle size, length 5 must remain in the initial JS chunk; the other 33 may be code-split via `import('…').then(…)` **only if** the bundle-size delta from static imports is judged unacceptable in 17.4 verification. Default plan: keep static imports (matches current Phase 2 pattern). Code-split is a fall-back lever, not a baseline change.
- **`src/data/bundled/` is kept on disk** (no deletion, per invariant) and updates its `source.json` to record that it is now a historical seed superseded by `src/latest/`. The seed JSONs remain valid emergency fallbacks; the loader does not consult them by default.
- **Hugging Face path stays compiled and tested** but is no longer the gameplay default. `refreshStore`'s in-memory swap can still be triggered by the admin route; gameplay reads the local source first and the refresh store only when the admin route has explicitly swapped a length in-session. Final wiring detail to be confirmed during 17.2.

### 22.4 Phase 17 — Sub-Phase Plan

| Sub-phase | Title | Files Touched (planned) | Verification |
|-----------|-------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 17.0 | Pre-flight, baseline capture, reconciliation note | none (read-only) | Re-confirm `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` all green at HEAD. Confirm 34 files present at `src/latest/`. Decide and document whether to keep `src/latest/` or `git mv` to `src/latest/brrrdle/` to match the spec wording. |
| 17.1 | Add local source loader & metadata adapter | **New**: `src/data/localWordLists.ts`, `src/data/localWordLists.test.ts`. **Edit (additive only)**: `src/data/types.ts` (add optional `curation?` to `WordListMetadata`), `src/data/wordListSchema.ts` (accept synthesized metadata, no removal of existing checks). | New unit tests covering: lengths 2, 5, 12, 20, 35 load; metadata is synthesized correctly; answers/validGuesses pass canonical schema; malformed local file is still rejected with `invalid-bundled-list`. |
| 17.2 | Re-point `BUNDLED_WORD_LISTS` to local source | **Edit**: `src/data/wordLists.ts` (re-export `LOCAL_WORD_LISTS` as `BUNDLED_WORD_LISTS`; keep `BUNDLED_WORD_LIST_LENGTHS` array). **Update**: `src/data/bundled/source.json` to mark itself as historical seed. **No change**: `src/data/loadWordList.ts`, `src/data/wordRepository.ts`. | `src/data/loadWordList.test.ts`, `src/data/wordRepository.test.ts`, `src/data/practiceLengthCoverage.test.ts` all green unchanged. Existing daily-length-locked tests unchanged. |
| 17.3 | Deprecate runtime HF fetch as default; keep it as optional admin override | **Edit (annotation/JSDoc only, no logic change)**: `src/data/huggingFaceSource.ts`, `src/data/refresh.ts`, `src/data/refreshStore.ts`, `src/data/updateCheck.ts`, `api/admin-refresh.ts`. | Existing HF-related tests (`huggingFaceSource.test.ts`, `refresh.test.ts`, `refreshStore.test.ts`, `updateCheck.test.ts`) remain green. Admin-route auth tests remain green. |
| 17.4 | Full verification & bundle-leak check | docs/changelog/progress only | Full §22.5 pipeline. |
| 17.5 | Progress tracking, CHANGELOG, halt for user approval | `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` (next contiguous IDs after Phase 16's last), `CHANGELOG.md` | Manual review of progress and changelog updates. |

Each sub-phase ends with a `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` and a `progress/PROGRESS.csv` row appended for the corresponding `phase_id`. The agent halts at every sub-phase gate per CONSTITUTION.md §4 unless the user explicitly authorizes contiguous execution.

### 22.5 Verification & Release Gate (Phase 17.4)

Required to pass before declaring Phase 17 complete:

1. `npm run lint` — clean.
2. `npm run test` — all existing tests pass with zero new failures. New tests added in 17.1 must:
   - Assert that lengths 2, 5, 12, 20, and 35 load real local content (answer count and valid-guess count match `src/latest/manifest.json` per-length counts to within an exact equality for `validGuesses` and exact equality for the curated `answers` subset shipped in each file).
   - Assert daily mode loads length 5 and rejects non-5 lengths.
   - Assert practice mode rejects length 1 and length 36.
   - Assert that one carefully chosen ordinary English word per representative length (a word previously reported as "not in list") now validates as a guess.
   - Assert that a deliberately malformed mock local JSON is rejected via the canonical schema, producing `reason: 'invalid-bundled-list'` (or the alias chosen in 17.1).
3. `npm run build` — clean. Bundle-size delta over HEAD recorded in `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md`. If the production JS bundle grows by more than +20% over current HEAD, fall back to the code-split plan described in §22.3.
4. `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` — clean.
5. Client-bundle leak checks (Phase 13/16 invariants), all run against `dist/`:
   - `grep -R "@vercel/blob" dist/` — no matches.
   - `grep -R "huggingface.co" dist/` — matches **only** inside dead-code-eliminated branches or admin-only modules; gameplay chunks must not contain any HF URL. If any gameplay chunk still references HF, treat it as a bug for 17.3 to fix by lazy-import.
   - No service-role keys, no Supabase admin secrets in `dist/`.
6. Definitions System manual smoke (Phase 6 invariant): post-game definition flow still works because the Dictionary API → Wiktionary → Google fallback chain handles the now-empty inline definitions cleanly; the Google search button remains always available.
7. Admin tab manual smoke (Phase 14 invariant): `/api/admin-refresh` still authenticates, still authorizes, still returns the same response shape. If a successful refresh is triggered, the new dataset is merged into `refreshStore` and gameplay reflects it without a reload — i.e., the local source acts as the default and the admin refresh acts as an opt-in override.
8. Auth flows, Word Explorer, Feedback, Sound Effects, Pay-to-Continue, sharing, and Phase 16 responsive UI: spot-checked unchanged.
9. CodeQL: run on changed lines after 17.3; any true-positive alerts must be fixed before 17.4 closes.

### 22.6 Preserved Invariants (Phase 17-specific re-statement)

- Daily 5-letter lock and practice 2..35 — unchanged.
- Hard Mode constraints — unchanged.
- Curated `answers` subset (BRRRDLE-ANSWERS-CURATION-SPEC) — preserved by reading the curated arrays already produced by `stratified_quality_score_v1` in each local file.
- Admin tab + `/api/admin-refresh` — preserved as an optional override.
- Word Explorer, Feedback, Sound Effects, Auth (`AuthModal`, `AccountBadge`, `ProfilePanel`, `classifyAuthError`, magic-link + password coexistence), Pay-to-Continue, sharing, definitions, stats, guest persistence, sync stub — untouched.
- Mobile/tablet responsiveness (Phase 16) — untouched.
- No file deletion. No test removal/skip/weakening. No new env vars, no service-role on client, no `@vercel/blob` in client bundle. No new runtime dependency.
- `src/data/index.ts` barrel export surface is preserved; any new exports (`LOCAL_WORD_LISTS`, `localWordListsManifest`) are additive.

### 22.7 Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Bundle-size regression from statically importing 34 large files in the main chunk. | Measure `dist/` size delta in 17.4; if > +20%, code-split lengths ≠ 5 via dynamic `import()` (loader becomes async for non-daily lengths; daily stays sync). |
| Path mismatch between spec (`src/latest/brrrdle/`) and repo (`src/latest/`). | Single loader-path constant in `localWordLists.ts`; either keep `src/latest/` and document, or `git mv` to `src/latest/brrrdle/` in 17.1 as a pure rename. |
| Existing schema validator rejects new metadata shape. | Synthesize legacy `WordListMetadata` from `src/latest/manifest.json` and per-length file in the adapter; do not weaken the validator. |
| Loss of inline definitions for curated answers (the local files don't carry them). | Existing Definitions System fallback chain (Phase 6) handles this — Dictionary API → Wiktionary → Google. Verification 22.5 §6 re-confirms. |
| Admin refresh path silently rots because gameplay no longer touches it. | Keep all existing HF tests green; Phase 17.3 only adds JSDoc deprecation notes; the cron route and `/api/admin-refresh` continue to compile and run. |
| Stale `src/data/bundled/` confuses future contributors. | Update `src/data/bundled/source.json.note` in 17.2 to explicitly state "Historical seed. Do not load at runtime. Superseded by `src/latest/` per LOCAL-WORD-LISTS-SPEC-2026-05-28." |
| Transitional length-5 compatibility files (`brrrdle_words.json`, `brrrdle_words.txt`) in `src/latest/` cause confusion. | Loader uses `words_length_N.json` filenames only; compatibility files are ignored. Documented in 17.1 progress notes. |

### 22.8 Out of Scope for Phase 17

- Changing the curated-answers algorithm.
- Adding inline definitions to the local per-length files.
- Removing or rewriting the Hugging Face fetch, refresh store, or admin refresh contract.
- Changing daily-mode length, practice-mode bounds, or any UI.
- Any documentation rewrite beyond the changelog entry and the seed `source.json` historical note.

### 22.9 Progress Tracking and CHANGELOG

- Append rows to `progress/PROGRESS.csv` for each of Phases 17.0 through 17.5, using the next contiguous `phase_id` values after the highest currently recorded ID. Titles follow the pattern `"Phase 17.x — <Sub-phase title>"`.
- Create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` from `progress/PROGRESS-TEMPLATE.md` for each sub-phase, summarising what changed, verification results, blockers, and explicit go/no-go for the next sub-phase.
- Add `[Unreleased] — Changed` and `[Unreleased] — Deprecated` entries to `CHANGELOG.md` for: local-first word-list loading, deprecation of the runtime HF fetch as the default gameplay path, and the seed-snapshot historical-note update.

### 22.10 Phase 17 Exit Checklist

- All §22.2 diagnoses are demonstrably resolved (daily and practice 2–35 load real local content, previously rejected ordinary words now validate).
- All §22.6 invariants verified intact.
- All §22.5 verification items green.
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-*.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` updated and free of sensitive data.
- Halt for explicit user approval before any production release action.

## 23. Phase 18 — Word List Difficulty Tiers + Word Explorer / Go / Settings Improvements (Addendum, PHASE-18-WORD-DIFFICULTY-AND-GO-IMPROVEMENTS-SPEC-2026-05-28)

**Plan Version**: 1.8 (addendum). Bound by `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.1, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`, the prior plan (Phases 0–17), and `PHASE-18-WORD-DIFFICULTY-AND-GO-IMPROVEMENTS-SPEC-2026-05-28.md` (the source of truth for this phase). Triggered by the user's Phase 18 spec requesting selectable answer-difficulty tiers, Word Explorer / Go-mode / Settings polish, and a critical daily Og↔Go overlap fix.

> Status: **No game code changes yet.** This addendum exists for user review. The only changes made during the drafting of this addendum are the §23.2 (Phase 18.0) governance/repo cleanup items that the user explicitly authorized for the planning stage (model-agnostic edits + a root `README.md` upgrade + documentation). All gameplay/feature implementation (18.1 onward) is gated on explicit user approval (see §23.13). On 2026-05-30 (plan v1.9), the user provided definitive answers to all five §23.11 open questions; those answers are now integrated below as resolved decisions, and the §23.11 section records them.

### 23.1 Scope, Source of Truth, and Operating Rules

- **Source of truth for this phase**: `PHASE-18-WORD-DIFFICULTY-AND-GO-IMPROVEMENTS-SPEC-2026-05-28.md` and this Section 23. If the spec and prior phases conflict, the spec wins for the narrow concerns it covers (answer-difficulty tiers, the Customize quick menu, Settings reorganization, Word Explorer difficulty column + per-row Define, Go-mode per-puzzle definitions and practice-only reveal, and the daily Og↔Go overlap fix). All other invariants from Phases 0–17 are preserved.
- **Constitutional fit / scope check**: `CONSTITUTION.md` §3.3 lists "Themes or sound effects" and "Additional game modes" as out of scope without approval, but sound effects and the Word Explorer/Feedback tabs were already explicitly approved and shipped via the `ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md` addendum (Phase 13). Phase 18 adds **no new game mode** and **no new monetization mechanic** — answer-difficulty tiers refine the existing answer-selection within the already-approved data layer, and the practice-only "Give Up / Reveal Answer" reuses the existing coin/streak economy. This addendum treats the user's Phase 18 spec as the explicit approval required by §3.3/§2 for these specific additions, and records that interpretation here for auditability. **Resolved (user answer #4, 2026-05-30): the user confirmed the Phase 18 spec serves as the §3.3/§2 scope approval for the difficulty tiers and the practice-only reveal.**
- **Non-negotiable preserved invariants** (carried unchanged from Phases 0–17):
  - Daily `og`/`go` locked at 5 letters; practice 2–35. Difficulty tiers do **not** introduce variable daily lengths.
  - `getTileStates`/`getGuessResult` remains the single source of truth for coloring (CONSTITUTION §7.1). Difficulty tiers touch **answer selection only**, never tile logic or Hard Mode.
  - **Valid Guesses are identical across all three tiers** (spec §1): tiers subset the **answers** pool only; `validGuesses` is always the full per-length list. This is the central correctness rule for the whole phase.
  - Admin tab + `/api/admin-refresh` server contract intact; local-source loader from Phase 17 remains the gameplay default.
  - Public sync-API data-layer signatures from Phase 17 remain backward-compatible; any new parameter (e.g., a `difficulty` selector) is **additive with a default that reproduces today's behavior** (default tier = **Expert** = current full curated list, per spec §1).
  - No file deletion. No removal/skip/weakening of existing tests. No service-role on client. No `@vercel/blob` in client bundle. No new runtime dependency unless justified by approved scope and cleared against advisories (CONSTITUTION §14).
- **Operating rules**: strictly minimal, cohesive, reviewable changes; re-read the relevant plan section before each sub-phase; halt at each sub-phase gate per CONSTITUTION §4 unless the user authorizes contiguous execution; update `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, the relevant `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` at every sub-phase; run `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit`, and the client-bundle leak checks before declaring any sub-phase complete; run CodeQL on changed lines.

### 23.2 Phase 18.0 — Governance & Repository Cleanup (Model-Agnostic) — performed in the planning stage

This sub-step is the only part of Phase 18 executed during plan drafting, per the user's explicit instruction to perform the allowed constitution/repo cleanup now while deferring all game code changes.

**What was reviewed and changed now (planning stage):**

1. **`BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md` made model-agnostic.** The three GPT-5.5 references were rewritten so the plan no longer assumes a specific model:
   - Title: "Autonomous GPT-5.5 Copilot Agent Build" → "Autonomous Copilot Agent Build".
   - Core Approach line: "GitHub Copilot agent (GPT-5.5) sessions" → "a GitHub Copilot coding agent (model-agnostic — any sufficiently capable model, e.g. Claude Opus 4.8)".
   - Goal line: "the autonomous GPT-5.5 Copilot workflow" → "the autonomous Copilot agent workflow (model-agnostic)".
   - A repo-wide grep (`GPT-5`, `GPT 5`, `gpt-5`, `GPT5`) afterward returns **zero** matches across `*.md`, `*.ts`, `*.tsx`, `*.json`, `*.html`. No rules, scope, or success criteria were removed — only the model attribution changed.
2. **`CONSTITUTION.md` reviewed in the planning stage; the approved phase-range amendment is applied in Prompt 2 (not in the planning stage).** The constitution names **no** model anywhere, so no model-agnostic edit is required — it is already model-neutral and suitable for Claude Opus 4.8 or any capable model. Two staleness observations were recorded for the user during planning (the agent does **not** self-edit the binding constitution outside an explicitly approved amendment, per CONSTITUTION §17):
   - §1/§5/§5.2 said the plan "defines Phases 0 through 11," which predates the approved Phase 12–18 addenda. **Resolved (user answer #3) and APPLIED in Prompt 2 (2026-05-30):** generalized to "Phases 0–11 plus all subsequently approved addenda (Phases 12+)" in `CONSTITUTION.md` §1, §5, and §5.2 (with a new §5.2 addenda note), plus a §4 review-gate clarification, a §17 amendment record, and a version bump v3.1 → **v3.2**. No rule was removed or weakened.
   - §4 / §5.2's enumerated phase list could optionally cite the addendum sections (§§16–23). Applied in Prompt 2 as a §5.2 note pointing at the plan's addendum sections; the §4 gate was also clarified to cover "any constitution upgrade or amendment" and "every later phase … (including all subsequently approved addenda, Phases 12+)."
3. **Light repository organization — evaluated, conservative action taken.** The repository root holds many dated governance/spec/report files (`ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md`, `AUTH-UX-IMPROVEMENTS-SPEC-2026-05-27.md`, `LOCAL-WORD-LISTS-SPEC-2026-05-28.md`, `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-*.md`, `VERCEL-*-LOGS-*.md`, `PHASE-18-…-SPEC-2026-05-28.md`). A cross-reference scan shows **nearly all are referenced by bare filename** from `AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, multiple `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md`, and even a source test (`src/wordExplorer/wordExplorerData.test.ts` references `ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md`). Physically moving them now would silently break those governance references. **Resolved (user answer #5):** the user elected to **keep the current root layout for now** and defer any reorganization to a later optional cleanup phase. Per that decision and the "do not delete or edit game scripts" / minimal-change mandate, **no files were moved.**
4. **Root `README.md` upgraded (planning stage).** Per the user's explicit Phase 18.0 instruction, the root `README.md` was rewritten into a professional, comprehensive, visually appealing project README. It adds: a project tagline + badge row, a features overview (modes, difficulty tiers preview, progression/economy, accounts/sync, definitions, sharing, PWA, Word Explorer/Feedback/sound), a "Why brrrdle" section, a quick-start, a full tech-stack table, available-scripts table, environment-variable guidance (public-only, no secrets), Supabase/admin setup, deployment targets, an updated repository-structure tree (now including `src/latest/`), a governance/authoritative-sources section, a contributing guide reflecting the phase-gated workflow, and accessibility/security notes. **No facts were invented:** scripts, env vars, structure, and behavior were taken from `package.json`, `.env.example`, the on-disk tree, and existing docs. This is a documentation-only change.
5. **`BRRRDLE-SPEC.md` reviewed; left unchanged.** It names no model and required no model-agnostic edit.

**Documentation of the cleanup** lives in `CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased → Phase 18.0 entry) and `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-35.md`, with a `progress/PROGRESS.csv` row at `phase_id = 35`.

**Verification for 18.0**: documentation-only changes (no source, no tooling). `git diff --check` clean; repo-wide GPT-5 grep returns zero matches. Lint/build/test are not required for Markdown-only governance/README edits per the plan's operating rules, and were therefore not run for 18.0.

### 23.3 Diagnosis of the Daily Og↔Go Overlap Bug (spec §5)

Confirmed against HEAD:

- `src/game/go/session.ts` builds the **daily** go answer sequence with `selectAnswerSequence(repository.answers, getDailyAnswerIndex(dateKey, repository.answers.length))` (lines ~87–88), where `repository` is `getWordRepository({ mode: 'go', scope: 'daily', length: 5 })`.
- `src/data/daily.ts` `getDailyOgPuzzle` picks the daily **og** answer with the *same* `getDailyAnswerIndex(dateKey, answers.length)` against `getWordRepository({ mode: 'og', scope: 'daily', length: 5 })`.
- Because og and go daily both resolve to the identical length-5 curated `answers` array and the identical seed index for a given `dateKey`, **the first go puzzle is consistently the same word as the daily og answer.** This is the exact symptom the spec calls out.

**Root cause**: a single shared seed function (`getDailyAnswerIndex`) with no mode-specific offset/salt. The fix must give daily go an **independent** deterministic seed while keeping both deterministic per `dateKey` (so the daily puzzle is stable for all players on a date) and keeping daily go's five words mutually distinct (existing behavior).

### 23.4 Proposed Solution — Difficulty Tiers (spec §1)

Central rule: **tiers subset answers only; valid guesses are always the full list.**

- **Tier model**: introduce a `DifficultyTier = 'casual' | 'standard' | 'expert'` type in the game/data layer with `DEFAULT_DIFFICULTY_TIER = 'expert'` (spec default reproduces today's behavior). Expert = the full curated `answers` already shipped per length in `src/latest/words_length_N.json`.
- **Answer-subset derivation** (the key design decision — needs a data source for Casual/Standard):
  - **Expert**: the existing curated `answers` array verbatim. No new data.
  - **Standard**: union (or larger) of the classic official Wordle answer list and the classic Hurdle answer set. These exist **only at length 5**. **Resolved (user answers #1 + #2):**
    - **Length 5**: ship a small curated `standard-5` answer list as a static JSON asset under `src/data/difficulty/`, built as the **union (or a larger superset) of the classic Wordle + Hurdle answer sets**, intersected with the shipped Expert length-5 `answers` so `Standard ⊆ Expert` holds.
    - **Lengths ≠ 5**: define **Standard as "Expert minus the rarest stratum"** — i.e., drop the lowest-quality/rarest tail of Expert using the same deterministic in-repo heuristic that powers Casual (see below), with a less aggressive cutoff than Casual. This guarantees `Casual ⊆ Standard ⊆ Expert` at every length 2–35 and is unit-tested as a hard invariant.
  - **Casual**: "common/frequent words only, dynamically scaled per length" (spec §1). The current per-length JSONs carry **no per-word frequency score** at runtime (only a `metadata.curation` description of the offline `stratified_quality_score_v1` method). **Resolved (user answer #1):** compute the Casual (and non-5 Standard) tiers **in-repo via a deterministic heuristic** from the existing local JSON files — **no external data-pipeline dependency**. The heuristic reproducibly scores each Expert word per length (e.g., letter-frequency / positional-frequency / vowel-balance, mirroring the spirit of the offline `stratified_quality_score_v1`) and selects a stable top fraction per length as Casual, and a larger stable top fraction as non-5 Standard. The scoring must be pure/deterministic (no randomness, no clock, no network) so the same inputs always yield the same tiers, and the loader stays **ready to consume explicit per-word tier/score tags** if a future data regeneration ships them (forward-compatible, but not required now).
  - **Performance**: subsetting happens at answer-selection time from already-loaded per-length data; no extra network and no daily-mode slowdown. Casual/Standard subset computation must be memoized per (length, tier).
- **Selection wiring**:
  - Add an **additive, defaulted** `difficulty?: DifficultyTier` to the answer-selection path (`WordRepositoryRequest` and the daily/practice selectors), defaulting to Expert so all existing callers and tests are unchanged.
  - `getAnswerCandidates` / daily+practice selectors filter the Expert `answers` down to the requested tier's subset. `validateGuess`/`getValidGuesses` are **untouched** (full list always).
- **Persistence** (spec §1, §6): the **global default tier** is a new user setting saved to the guest profile (`GuestSettingsState`) and, when signed in, to the Supabase profile alongside other preferences. A **per-game override** is selected via the Customize quick menu and is **locked once a game starts** (changing it requires a new game).

### 23.5 Proposed Solution — UI: Customize Quick Menu + Settings (spec §1, §2)

- **Customize quick menu** (creative-but-tasteful per spec/Agent Instructions): a small **"Customize"** button near the mode selector opens an accessible popover/quick menu exposing the three tiers (Casual/Standard/Expert) with short descriptions/tooltips and a **"Save as default"** button. Selecting a tier sets the per-game override; "Save as default" also persists it as the global default. Once a game is in progress the control is disabled/locked with a clear hint ("Start a new game to change difficulty"). Reuse existing `ui/Dialog`/`Panel`/`Button` primitives; honor focus-trap, ESC-to-close, reduced-motion, and WCAG-AA contrast (CONSTITUTION §12.2).
- **Settings reorganization** (spec §2): move the existing **Hard Mode** control into the same section as the new **global difficulty** selector (Hard Mode currently lives per-game in `OgGame.tsx`/`GoGame.tsx` via `session.hardMode`, with `hardModeDefault` already stored in `GuestSettingsState`; the Settings section gains a global Hard-Mode-default toggle co-located with the difficulty selector — the per-game Hard Mode toggles remain). Add accessible **tooltips** (hover + click/focus) for the major settings in this section. Tooltips must be keyboard-reachable and screen-reader friendly.

### 23.6 Proposed Solution — Word Explorer (spec §3)

- Add a **"Difficulty"** column to `src/wordExplorer/WordExplorerPanel.tsx` / `wordExplorerData.ts` showing the applicable tier label per word: `"Casual"`, `"Standard + Expert"`, `"Expert only"`, computed from the same nested-subset logic in §23.4 (so a word in Casual is by definition also in Standard and Expert). The column is **filterable and sortable** consistent with the existing Word Explorer table affordances. Non-answer valid-guess-only rows render an explicit "—/Valid guess only" so the answer-vs-guess distinction stays clear.
- Add a **"Define"** button per row that opens the existing post-game definition surface (`src/definitions/DefinitionPanel.tsx`) in a modal, including the always-available Google fallback (CONSTITUTION §9). Reuse the existing `definitionService` lookup order; no new definition source.

### 23.7 Proposed Solution — Go Mode (spec §4)

- **Per-puzzle definitions**: after each go puzzle is solved correctly, render its definition **below the grid**, stacking vertically as subsequent puzzles are solved. Reuse `DefinitionPanel`/`definitionService`; the existing end-of-chain `DefinitionPanel` in `GoGame.tsx` stays. Add a **"Hide Definitions" / "Show All"** toggle controlling the stacked list.
- **Give Up / Reveal Answer (practice only)**: add a button rendered **only when `scope === 'practice'`** in `GoGame.tsx`. Revealing applies an appropriate coin/streak penalty using the **existing** economy helpers (no new monetization mechanic). It must integrate with stats as a loss-equivalent for that puzzle and must not appear in daily go. Daily go remains penalty-locked to preserve fairness. Edge cases: insufficient coins, reveal on the last puzzle, and reveal interacting with Pay-to-Continue must all be specified and tested.

### 23.8 Proposed Solution — Daily Og↔Go Overlap Fix (spec §5)

- Give daily go an **independent deterministic seed** so its first word is not tied to the daily og index. Approach: add a mode/scope **salt** to the daily index derivation (e.g., a dedicated `getDailyGoSeedIndex(dateKey, answerCount)` or a salted variant of `getDailyAnswerIndex` that incorporates a stable `'go'` discriminator), keeping determinism per `dateKey` and preserving the five-word mutual-distinctness already guaranteed by `selectAnswerSequence`. The fix must guarantee, via unit test across a range of `dateKey`s, that **daily go's first word differs from the daily og answer** for that date (allowing the rare legitimate coincidence only if mathematically unavoidable for a tiny answer pool — assert inequality for length-5 where the pool is large).
- This is the spec's only item flagged **Critical** and should be sequenced early (its own sub-phase, 18.5) so it can ship independently of the larger tier/UI work if the user wants a fast fix.

### 23.9 Proposed Solution — Preferences Persistence & Future-Proofing (spec §6)

- Persist as many user settings as possible — **including the difficulty tier** — to the Supabase profile when signed in, reusing the existing profile/sync plumbing (`src/account/profile.ts`, `sync.ts`, `storageSchema.ts`). All additions to `GuestSettingsState` are **additive with safe defaults** and a guest-storage schema migration that preserves existing data (CONSTITUTION §15: "preserve existing user data and migration paths"). Bump `GUEST_PROGRESS_SCHEMA_VERSION` only if the shape changes, with a forward-compatible migration.
- **Future-proof for "resume most recent unfinished game"**: do **not** implement resume in this phase, but ensure the new settings/serialization shapes leave room for it (e.g., reserve a clearly-named optional slot) without enabling it. No behavior change.

### 23.10 Phase 18 — Sub-Phase Plan

| Sub-phase | `phase_id` | Title | Files Touched (planned) | Verification |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 18.0 | 35 | Governance & repo cleanup (model-agnostic) + root README upgrade — **done in planning stage** | `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md` (model-agnostic), `README.md` (professional upgrade), `AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` (this §23), `CHANGELOG.md`, `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-35.md` | Markdown-only; `git diff --check`; repo-wide GPT-5 grep = 0 matches |
| 18.1 | 36 | Pre-flight & baseline capture (doc reorg **declined** by user answer #5; root layout retained) | read-only baseline | Re-confirm `npm run lint` / `npm run test` / `npm run build` / `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` green at HEAD |
| 18.2 | 37 | Difficulty-tier data model & answer-subset logic (answers-only; valid guesses untouched) | **New**: `src/data/difficulty/` (tier types, subset derivation, optional `standard-5` asset, tests). **Edit (additive)**: answer-selection path in `wordRepository.ts`/`daily.ts`/`go/session.ts` with defaulted `difficulty` | Unit tests: `Casual ⊆ Standard ⊆ Expert` for all lengths 2–35; Expert == today's answers; `validGuesses` byte-identical across tiers; daily 5-lock and practice 2–35 unchanged |
| 18.3 | 38 | Settings reorg + global difficulty selector + tooltips | **Edit**: `src/account/Settings.tsx`, `src/account/storageSchema.ts` (additive setting + migration) | Tests for migration/back-compat; a11y checks (focus, tooltips, contrast) |
| 18.4 | 39 | Customize quick menu + per-game override (lock-on-start) + "Save as default" | **New** quick-menu component; **Edit**: mode selector area, `OgGame.tsx`/`GoGame.tsx` to consume override | Tests: override applied; locked once started; save-as-default persists; a11y/focus-trap |
| 18.5 | 40 | **Critical** daily Og↔Go overlap fix | **Edit**: `src/data/daily.ts` and/or `src/game/go/session.ts` (salted daily-go seed) | Unit test across many `dateKey`s: daily-go first word ≠ daily-og answer at length 5; five go words remain distinct; determinism per date preserved |
| 18.6 | 41 | Word Explorer difficulty column (filter/sort) + per-row Define modal | **Edit**: `src/wordExplorer/wordExplorerData.ts`, `WordExplorerPanel.tsx` | Tests: tier label correctness, filter/sort, Define modal opens with Google fallback |
| 18.7 | 42 | Go-mode per-puzzle definitions stack + Hide/Show toggle + practice-only Reveal | **Edit**: `src/app/games/GoGame.tsx`, go session/state | Tests: definition shown on solve, toggle, reveal practice-only with penalty + stats, daily unaffected |
| 18.8 | 43 | Supabase preference sync (incl. tier) + resume-game-ready shapes | **Edit**: `src/account/sync.ts`, `profile.ts`, `storageSchema.ts` | Tests: signed-in persistence, guest fallback, migration, no behavior change for resume slot |
| 18.9 | 44 | Final integration, cross-feature verification & release gate | docs/changelog/progress only | Full §23.12 pipeline + CodeQL |

Each sub-phase ends with a `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md`, a `progress/PROGRESS.csv` row, a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and a halt for explicit user approval per CONSTITUTION §4 unless the user authorizes contiguous execution.

> **Phase-id note (3-prompt workflow).** Phase 18.0 (planning) is recorded at `phase_id = 35`. The Prompt 2 constitution/repo adjustments (this amendment) are recorded at `phase_id = 36` (`progress/PROGRESS-STEP-36.md`). The feature sub-phases 18.1–18.9 above keep their projected `phase_id` column for planning purposes; their final `phase_id` integers are assigned sequentially (37+) when each is executed in Prompt 3.

### 23.11 Resolved User Answers (formerly Open Questions)

On 2026-05-30 the user provided definitive answers to all five questions. They are now binding decisions for Phase 18 and are integrated above (§23.2, §23.4). No open questions remain blocking.

1. **Casual/Standard data source** (§23.4): **Resolved → compute tiers in-repo via a deterministic heuristic from the existing local JSON files** (default approach; no external data-pipeline dependency). The loader stays forward-compatible with explicit per-word tier/score tags if a future data regeneration ships them.
2. **Standard at non-5 lengths** (§23.4): **Resolved → define Standard as "Expert minus the rarest stratum"** for lengths ≠ 5 (drop the lowest-quality tail). For length 5, use the **union (or larger superset) of the classic Wordle + Hurdle answer sets**. `Casual ⊆ Standard ⊆ Expert` is preserved at every length and unit-tested.
3. **Constitution amendment** (§23.2): **Resolved → approved and APPLIED in Prompt 2 (2026-05-30).** Generalized CONSTITUTION §1/§5/§5.2 "Phases 0 through 11" to "Phases 0–11 plus all subsequently approved addenda (Phases 12+)," with supporting §4/§5.2/§17 clarifications and a version bump v3.1 → v3.2. No rule was removed or weakened.
4. **Scope approval** (§23.1): **Resolved → confirmed.** The Phase 18 spec serves as the explicit CONSTITUTION §3.3/§2 approval for the difficulty tiers and the practice-only reveal.
5. **Optional doc reorg** (§23.2/18.1): **Resolved → keep the current root layout for now;** defer any reorganization to a later optional cleanup phase.

### 23.12 Verification & Release Gate (Phase 18.9)

1. `npm run lint` — clean.
2. `npm run test` — all existing tests pass with zero new failures; new tests added per sub-phase, including the nesting invariant, the valid-guess-identity-across-tiers invariant, and the daily Og↔Go inequality invariant.
3. `npm run build` — clean; record bundle-size delta; keep daily-mode (length 5) fast.
4. `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` — clean.
5. Client-bundle leak checks against `dist/`: no `@vercel/blob`; no service-role/Supabase admin secrets; no regression in HF-URL occurrence vs. Phase 17 baseline.
6. Manual smokes: difficulty selection (default Expert reproduces current behavior), Customize lock-on-start, Settings tooltips/a11y, Word Explorer difficulty filter/sort + Define modal, Go per-puzzle definitions + practice-only reveal penalty, daily Og↔Go non-overlap, signed-in preference sync + guest migration.
7. CodeQL on changed lines; fix any true-positive before the gate closes.

### 23.13 Phase 18 Exit Checklist

- Difficulty tiers subset **answers only**, valid guesses identical across tiers, default tier Expert reproduces current behavior; `Casual ⊆ Standard ⊆ Expert` for all lengths.
- Settings reorganized with co-located Hard Mode + difficulty and accessible tooltips; Customize quick menu with lock-on-start and Save-as-default.
- Word Explorer difficulty column (filter/sort) and per-row Define modal in place.
- Go per-puzzle definitions stack + Hide/Show toggle; practice-only Reveal with correct penalty/stats; daily unaffected.
- Daily Og↔Go overlap fixed and unit-tested.
- Preferences (incl. tier) persist to guest storage and Supabase when signed in, with a data-preserving migration; resume-ready shapes reserved but not enabled.
- Daily 5-letter lock and practice 2–35 preserved; all §23.1 invariants intact.
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-*.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` updated and free of sensitive data.
- All §23.11 questions resolved by the user (2026-05-30); decisions integrated into §23.2/§23.4. Constitution amendment (answer #3) applied in prompt 2.
- Halt for explicit user approval before any production release action.

## 24. Phase 19 — Enhanced Statistics Visualizations, Configurable Go Puzzle Count, Full Resume-Most-Recent-Game Activation, Advanced Polish & Theming Foundations (Addendum, PHASE-19-ENHANCED-STATS-RESUME-CONFIGURABLE-GO-AND-POLISH-SPEC-2026-05-30)

**Plan Version**: 2.2 (addendum). Bound by `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.2, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`, the prior plan (Phases 0–18), and `PHASE-19-ENHANCED-STATS-RESUME-CONFIGURABLE-GO-AND-POLISH-SPEC-2026-05-30.md` (the **binding source of truth** for this phase). Triggered by the user's Phase 19 spec requesting a richer statistics dashboard, a configurable Go puzzle count (5/7/10), full activation of the resume-most-recent-unfinished-game slot reserved in Phase 18, advanced polish/accessibility, and a light theming foundation. Executed via the user's 3-prompt workflow; **Prompt 1 (planning)** drafted this addendum (v2.1) and **Prompt 2 (governance/clarity)** confirmed the `phase_id = 46` numbering decision and applied the final non-code adjustments (v2.2).

> Status: **Phase 19 feature execution complete (Prompt 3).** Sub-phases 19.1–19.6 are implemented and verified on the working branch (final ids 48–53): 19.1 Enhanced Statistics Dashboard, 19.2 Configurable Go Puzzle Count (5/7/10), 19.3 Resume Most-Recent Unfinished Game, 19.4 Advanced Polish & Accessibility (sound categories + a11y/motion audit), 19.5 Light Theming Foundation (4 accent-only themes), and 19.6 Final Integration & Release Gate. Full verification matrix green (`npm ci`; lint; **test 321/321**; build; `tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit`; client-bundle leak checks; `git diff --check`) and CodeQL clean (0 alerts). All invariants preserved (daily 5-letter lock; practice 2–35; valid guesses identical across tiers; default Expert). **Halt before any production release** per CONSTITUTION §4: the user reviews/merges and performs any manual Vercel/Supabase follow-up.

### 24.1 Scope, Source of Truth, and Operating Rules

- **Source of truth for this phase**: `PHASE-19-ENHANCED-STATS-RESUME-CONFIGURABLE-GO-AND-POLISH-SPEC-2026-05-30.md` and this Section 24. If the spec and prior phases conflict, the spec wins for the narrow concerns it covers (statistics visualizations, configurable Go puzzle count, resume activation, polish/theming). All other invariants from Phases 0–18 are preserved.
- **Constitutional fit / scope check**: `CONSTITUTION.md` §3.3 lists "Themes or sound effects" as out of scope without approval. Phase 19's **Light Theming Foundation** (accent/border-only "Icy/Classic/Neon/Country Flag" selection) and **categorized sound effects** are treated as **explicitly approved** by the Phase 19 spec (spec §1, §3), which the user approved for autonomous execution. Sound effects were already shipped via the `ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md` addendum (Phase 13); Phase 19 only categorizes/refines them. Phase 19 adds **no new game mode** and **no new monetization mechanic** (spec §1 "Out of scope": monetization changes, multiplayer, leaderboards, heavy AI hints remain reserved). This addendum records the Phase 19 spec as the §3.3/§2 approval for theming and sound categorization, for auditability.
- **Non-negotiable preserved invariants** (carried unchanged from Phases 0–18):
  - Daily `og`/`go` locked at 5 letters; practice 2–35 (CONSTITUTION §3.1). The configurable Go puzzle count changes **how many puzzles are in a Go chain (5/7/10)**, never the per-puzzle word length, and never unlocks variable daily lengths.
  - `getTileStates`/`getGuessResult` remains the single source of truth for tile coloring and Hard Mode (CONSTITUTION §7.1). No Phase 19 feature recomputes coloring.
  - **Valid Guesses identical across all difficulty tiers**; difficulty tiers subset **answers only** (Phase 18 §23.1 invariant) — unchanged by Phase 19.
  - **Default difficulty tier = Expert** reproduces current behavior (Phase 18). Phase 19's new defaults follow the same rule: each new setting is **additive with a default that reproduces today's behavior** — default Go count = **5**, default theme = **Icy** (current look), resume = **off until a real unfinished game exists**.
  - Per-mode statistics separation (`og` vs `go`) and the per-length foundation (CONSTITUTION §11.2) are preserved; the new dashboard **visualizes existing stats**, it does not change how stats are computed or unlock variable daily lengths.
  - Guest-first: every feature must work for guests with local storage; signed-in users additionally sync via the existing Supabase profile plumbing. Auto-resume "works for signed-in users" (spec §2) but the resume **button** also works for guests when a local unfinished game exists.
  - Admin tab + `/api/admin-refresh` server contract intact; local-source loader (Phase 17) remains the gameplay default; difficulty tiers (Phase 18) untouched.
  - No file deletion. No removal/skip/weakening of existing tests. No service-role on client. No `@vercel/blob` in client bundle. **No new heavy charting dependency** — spec §2 requires "simple, accessible libraries already in the ecosystem (no new heavy deps)"; the dashboard must be built from lightweight, accessible, dependency-free SVG/CSS primitives (or an already-present dependency), not a new heavy chart library. Any dependency at all requires advisory clearance (CONSTITUTION §14) and explicit justification.
  - All new features must be "toggleable/off-by-default where appropriate and fully testable" (spec §2).
- **Operating rules**: strictly minimal, cohesive, reviewable changes; re-read the relevant plan section before each sub-phase; halt at each sub-phase gate per CONSTITUTION §4 unless the user authorizes contiguous execution; update `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, the relevant `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` at every sub-phase; run `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run build`, and `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit`, plus the client-bundle leak checks, before declaring any sub-phase complete; run CodeQL on changed lines.

### 24.2 Phase 19.0 — Planning Stage: Governance & Repository Cleanup + README Polish (performed now)

This sub-step is the only part of Phase 19 executed during plan drafting, per the user's explicit Prompt-1 instruction to draft the addendum and perform the allowed light governance/repo cleanup while deferring all game code changes.

**What was reviewed and changed now (planning stage):**

1. **Authoritative documents reviewed in order** (per the Prompt-1 instruction): `CONSTITUTION.md` (v3.2), `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, `AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` (v2.0 → now v2.1), the new `PHASE-19-…-SPEC-2026-05-30.md`, the root `README.md`, and the relevant source areas (`src/stats/`, `src/game/go/`, `src/game/constants.ts`, `src/account/` — `storageSchema.ts`, `guestStorage.ts`, `profile.ts`, `sync.ts`, `auth.ts`, `Settings.tsx`, `ProfilePanel.tsx`, `src/app/games/`, `src/sound/`). Findings are captured in §24.3.
2. **Model-agnostic / clarity review.** A repo-wide scan for hard-coded model attributions (`GPT-5*`, `GPT5`) in governance/source files returns **zero** matches; the remaining model references in `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`, `README.md`, and the plan are already phrased model-agnostically (e.g. "any sufficiently capable model, e.g. Claude Opus 4.8"). No model-attribution edit is required this phase. The binding `CONSTITUTION.md` names no model and is left untouched (the agent does not self-edit the constitution outside an explicitly approved amendment, per CONSTITUTION §17).
3. **Plan addendum appended (this §24)** and the plan version bumped v2.0 → **v2.1** with an updated header changelog line.
4. **Root `README.md` polished (planning stage).** The stale "Project status" line (which still said "through Phase 17 … Phase 18 … planned and awaiting approval") is corrected to reflect that Phase 18 is implemented and Phase 19 is now planned and awaiting approval; the features list is lightly updated to mention answer-difficulty tiers (shipped in Phase 18) and to preview the approved Phase 19 enhancements (richer stats dashboard, configurable Go count, resume, theming). **No facts were invented** — the changes reflect on-disk code (Phase 18 difficulty tiers in `src/data/difficulty/`, the reserved `resumeSlot`, the existing accent-color profile field) and the approved Phase 19 spec. Documentation-only change.
5. **Repository organization — evaluated, no files moved.** Consistent with the Phase 18.0 decision (§23.2 item 3; user answer #5: keep the current root layout, defer reorganization), the many dated root governance/spec/report files are referenced by bare filename across the plan, changelog, progress reports, and a source test, so moving them now would break governance references. No files were moved or deleted.
6. **`BRRRDLE-SPEC.md` and `CONSTITUTION.md` reviewed; left unchanged.** Neither names a model; neither requires a Phase 19 edit. No constitution amendment is required for Phase 19 (the v3.2 phase-range generalization already covers "all subsequently approved addenda, Phases 12+").

**Progress-step numbering note (deviation from the literal prompt — now confirmed by the user).** The Prompt-1 instruction said to "create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-37.md` for the planning stage." However, `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-37.md` **already exists** and records **Phase 18.1** (the progress sequence currently runs through `PROGRESS-STEP-45.md` / `phase_id = 45`, Phase 18.9). Overwriting step 37 would destroy an existing phase record, violating CONSTITUTION §15 ("preserve existing user data and migration paths") and the no-deletion rule. To honor the **intent** of the instruction (create a planning-stage progress report) without destroying data, the Phase 19.0 planning report was recorded at the **next sequential** id, **`progress/PROGRESS-STEP-46.md` / `phase_id = 46`**, and the discrepancy was flagged to the user. **In Prompt 2 the user reviewed and explicitly approved this decision** ("use `phase_id = 46` / `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-46.md` — smart preservation of existing records"); the numbering is therefore **confirmed**, and subsequent Phase 19 steps continue sequentially from it (Prompt 2 itself is recorded at `phase_id = 47`; see §24.10).

**Documentation of the cleanup** lives in `CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased → Phase 19.0 entry) and `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-46.md`, with a `progress/PROGRESS.csv` row at `phase_id = 46`.

**Prompt 2 adjustments (governance/clarity only — performed now, `phase_id = 47`).** After the user reviewed Prompt 1 and approved the numbering decision, Prompt 2 applied the final constitution/repo adjustments: recorded the **confirmed** `phase_id = 46` numbering decision in this §24.2, in the §24.10 phase-id note, and in the §24.12 exit checklist; bumped the plan version **v2.1 → v2.2** with an updated header changelog line; and refreshed the stale "flagged for confirmation" cross-references to "confirmed." **No constitution amendment is required for Phase 19** — `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.2 already binds "all subsequently approved addenda, Phases 12+" to the same rules as Phases 0–11, names no model, and (per CONSTITUTION §17) is not self-edited outside an explicitly approved amendment. **No game code, tests, or source files were touched.** Documentation is recorded in `CHANGELOG.md` (Unreleased → Phase 19 Prompt 2 entry) and `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-47.md`, with a `progress/PROGRESS.csv` row at `phase_id = 47`.

**Verification for 19.0**: planning/documentation-only changes (Markdown only — plan, README, changelog, progress). The pre-existing baseline was nonetheless confirmed green before drafting (`npm run lint` clean, `npm run test` **292/292**, `npm run build` clean, `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` clean) so sub-phase 19.1 starts from a known-good state. `git diff --check` clean; repo-wide GPT-5 grep returns zero matches.

### 24.3 Diagnosis of Current Stats / Resume / Configurable-Go / Theming State (against HEAD)

**Statistics (spec §3 / sub-phase 19.1).**
- The model lives in `src/stats/`: `types.ts` (`GameStatsBucket` with `played/won/lost/currentStreak/maxStreak/totalAttempts/bestAttempts/byLength`, and `StatisticsState = Record<GameMode, Record<PlayScope, GameStatsBucket>>`), `statistics.ts` (`createEmptyStatistics`, `updateStatistics`, `getStatsBucket`, `getWinRate`, `getAverageAttempts`), and `StatsDashboard.tsx`.
- `StatsDashboard.tsx` currently renders **four static numeric cards** (og daily, og practice, go daily, go practice), each showing Played, Win rate %, Current/Max streak, Best/Avg attempts. There are **no charts** (no win-rate-by-tier/length bars, no streak calendar, no XP-progress visual, no coin-usage trend). Per-length data (`byLength`) is **stored but not visualized**.
- XP/level/coins live separately in `GuestProgressionState` (`storageSchema.ts`); coin/XP awards and history are in `GuestProgressState.history` (`GameHistoryEntry[]` includes `coinAward`, `xpAward`, `completedAt`, `wordLength`). **The dashboard does not currently read `history` or `progression`** — the raw material for XP-progress and coin-usage-trend visuals already exists but is unwired.
- **Gap for 19.1**: add interactive, accessible charts (win rate by mode/scope and by length/tier; streak calendar from `history.completedAt`; XP progress from `progression.xp`/level thresholds; coin-usage trend from `history.coinAward`) using lightweight in-repo SVG/CSS primitives — no new heavy dependency (spec §2). Difficulty tier is **not** currently captured per game in `GameHistoryEntry`; win-rate-by-tier needs either an additive `difficulty?` field on history entries going forward (additive, back-compatible) or a clear "tier data available from <date>" empty state for older entries. This is a design decision to settle in 19.1.

**Configurable Go puzzle count (spec §1 / sub-phase 19.2).**
- `src/game/constants.ts` hard-codes `GO_PUZZLE_COUNT = 5`. `src/game/go/session.ts` builds daily and practice chains using this constant; `src/game/go/session.test.ts` asserts `puzzles.toHaveLength(GO_PUZZLE_COUNT)`.
- `recordCompletedGame`'s `CompletedGameInput` already carries an optional `puzzleCount?: number` (`guestStorage.ts`), so the scoring path is partially ready for variable counts, but session construction, carry-over pre-fill logic, and the UI are all fixed at 5.
- **Gap for 19.2**: introduce a `GoPuzzleCount = 5 | 7 | 10` concept with `DEFAULT_GO_PUZZLE_COUNT = 5`; thread an **additive, defaulted** count through `createDailyGoSetup`/`createPracticeGoSetup`/`createGoSession` and the carry-over pre-fill; add a **global default** setting (guest + Supabase profile) and a **per-game override** via the existing `CustomizeMenu`, **locked once a game starts** (mirroring the Phase 18 difficulty lock-on-start). Daily Go may use the chosen count while each puzzle stays at the daily 5-letter length (count ≠ length — invariant preserved). Tests must cover 5/7/10 and the lock-after-start behavior.

**Resume most-recent unfinished game (spec §1, §2 / sub-phase 19.3).**
- Phase 18.8 reserved `GuestProgressState.resumeSlot?: unknown` (`storageSchema.ts`) and `guestTransfer.ts` already **preserves a reserved resume slot from either side without enabling it** (there is a passing test for this). The slot is currently always `undefined`; **no resume capture, UI, or auto-resume exists**.
- `og`/`go` sessions are serializable (`SerializedGoSession` exists in `go/session.ts`; Og sessions have analogous serialization), which is the substrate a resume feature needs.
- **Gap for 19.3**: define a concrete typed shape for `resumeSlot` (mode, scope, length, difficulty, Go count, serialized session, timestamp), capture/clear it as a game progresses/finishes, add a **home-screen Resume button that only appears when an unfinished game exists**, and **auto-resume on load for signed-in users** (spec §2). Must integrate with the schema migration (additive; only bump `GUEST_PROGRESS_SCHEMA_VERSION` if the persisted shape changes) and preserve all existing data. End-to-end test: start → leave → resume restores exact state.

**Advanced polish & accessibility (spec §1 / sub-phase 19.4).**
- Sound exists in `src/sound/` (`soundEngine.ts`, `SoundProvider.tsx`, toggle). Tile animations exist (pop-in/flip/shake) and honor reduced-motion. Touch scaling was addressed in Phase 16.
- **Gap for 19.4**: smoother/categorized tile animations, **sound categories** (e.g., key-press vs. win vs. loss vs. UI) layered on the existing engine, larger mobile touch targets where measured insufficient, and a **final a11y pass** (axe/lighthouse, focus order, contrast, keyboard navigation). Off-by-default/toggleable where appropriate.

**Light theming foundation (spec §1 / sub-phase 19.5).**
- A profile **accent color** concept already exists from Phase 15: `auth.ts` validates `accentColor` against an allow-list (`PROFILE_ACCENT_COLORS`, default `'ice'`) and persists `accent_color` to the Supabase profile; `profile.ts` derives accent into the UI. This is the natural substrate for theming.
- **Gap for 19.5**: a `Theme = 'icy' | 'classic' | 'neon' | 'country-flag'` selector (default `'icy'` = current look) in Settings/Customize, stored in the guest profile **and** the Supabase profile (reusing/extending the accent plumbing), applying **accent/border-only** changes for v1 (spec §1 — "UI changes limited to accents/borders for v1"). Must not alter layout, contrast minima, or tile coloring. Four themes switchable and persisted; tested.

**Final integration & release gate (spec §3 / sub-phase 19.6).**
- Cross-feature tests, changelog, progress update, full verification pipeline, manual smoke on a Vercel preview, and a "safe to merge & test" statement. Halt for explicit user approval before any production release action (CONSTITUTION §4).

### 24.4 Proposed Solution — Enhanced Statistics Dashboard (spec §3, sub-phase 19.1)

- **No new heavy dependency.** Build charts from small, accessible, in-repo SVG/CSS components (e.g., a reusable `<BarChart>`, `<CalendarHeatmap>`, `<ProgressMeter>`, `<TrendSparkline>` under `src/stats/charts/`) with text/`aria` fallbacks and a tabular equivalent for screen readers. If any already-present dependency suffices it may be reused after advisory clearance; otherwise dependency-free.
- **Visualizations** (all derived from existing data): win rate by mode/scope (and by length from `byLength`, and by tier once tier-tagged history exists), a streak calendar/heatmap from `history.completedAt`, XP-progress meter from `progression.xp` against level thresholds (reuse `src/progression`), and a coin-usage/earning trend from `history.coinAward`. Each chart is responsive and keyboard/screen-reader accessible (WCAG AA, CONSTITUTION §12.2).
- **Tier-aware win rate**: add an **additive, optional** `difficulty?: DifficultyTier` to `GameHistoryEntry` recorded going forward (back-compatible — older entries simply lack it and render in an "all/untagged" group). No migration of historical rows; default behavior unchanged.
- **Pure, testable selectors**: chart inputs come from pure functions in `statistics.ts` (or a new `statsSelectors.ts`) so they unit-test without rendering (CONSTITUTION §7.3 spirit). The existing four-card summary is preserved or folded into the richer view without losing any current number.

### 24.5 Proposed Solution — Configurable Go Puzzle Count (spec §1, sub-phase 19.2)

- **Type & default**: `GoPuzzleCount = 5 | 7 | 10`, `DEFAULT_GO_PUZZLE_COUNT = 5` in `src/game/constants.ts` (keep `GO_PUZZLE_COUNT = 5` as the default-valued constant or re-express it via the new default so existing imports/tests stay valid).
- **Session wiring (additive, defaulted)**: thread an optional `puzzleCount` (default 5) through `createDailyGoSetup`/`createPracticeGoSetup`/`createGoSession` and the carry-over pre-fill so chains of 7 or 10 build correctly and each later puzzle still pre-fills prior answers. Daily Go keeps each puzzle at the 5-letter daily length regardless of count (count ≠ length). Existing `selectAnswerSequence` distinctness must hold for 7/10 (the length-5 answer pool is large enough; assert in tests).
- **Persistence & override**: global default `goPuzzleCountDefault` added to `GuestSettingsState` (additive, defaulted to 5, migrated) and synced to the Supabase profile; per-game override in `CustomizeMenu` with **lock-on-start** (mirrors Phase 18 difficulty lock) and an inline "start a new game to change" hint.
- **Stats/economy**: `recordCompletedGame` already accepts `puzzleCount`; ensure the actual count flows in so coin/XP/stats reflect longer chains correctly. No new monetization mechanic.

### 24.6 Proposed Solution — Resume Most-Recent Unfinished Game (spec §1, §2, sub-phase 19.3)

- **Typed `resumeSlot`**: replace the reserved `unknown` with a concrete optional shape capturing `{ mode, scope, wordLength, difficulty, goPuzzleCount?, serializedSession, updatedAt }`. Bump `GUEST_PROGRESS_SCHEMA_VERSION` **only if** the persisted shape changes, with a forward-compatible, data-preserving migration; `guestTransfer.ts` already round-trips the slot.
- **Capture/clear**: write the slot as an unfinished game advances (debounced/at sensible checkpoints) and clear it on completion or explicit abandon. Reuse existing `SerializedGoSession`/Og serialization.
- **UI**: a **home-screen Resume button visible only when an unfinished game exists** (spec §2), restoring exact mode/scope/length/difficulty/count and board state. **Auto-resume on load for signed-in users** (spec §2); guests get the button (no surprise auto-navigation). Off when no slot exists.
- **Tests**: end-to-end start → leave → resume restores state for og and go; button hidden when no unfinished game; signed-in auto-resume; guest-transfer preserves the slot.

### 24.7 Proposed Solution — Advanced Polish & Accessibility (spec §1, sub-phase 19.4)

- **Animations**: smoother tile pop-in/flip/shake timings, still reduced-motion-aware and non-blocking (CONSTITUTION §12.3). **Sound categories** layered on `src/sound/soundEngine.ts` (e.g., `keypress | submit | win | loss | ui`) with per-category respect for the existing master toggle; off/at-current-behavior by default.
- **Touch & a11y**: audit and enlarge mobile touch targets where measured below comfortable minimums (building on Phase 16); run an axe/Lighthouse pass; verify focus order, dialog focus traps, status announcements, contrast, and full keyboard navigation. Document residual findings.

### 24.8 Proposed Solution — Light Theming Foundation (spec §1, sub-phase 19.5)

- **Type & default**: `Theme = 'icy' | 'classic' | 'neon' | 'country-flag'`, default `'icy'` (current look). Selector surfaced in Settings (global default) and optionally `CustomizeMenu`.
- **Storage**: persist to the guest profile (additive `themeDefault` setting, migrated) **and** the Supabase profile, reusing/extending the Phase 15 accent plumbing (`auth.ts` `accent_color`/allow-list, `profile.ts` derivation). Validate against an allow-list (untrusted-input safe).
- **Application**: **accent/border-only** CSS-variable swaps for v1 — no layout change, no tile-coloring change, preserved contrast minima (spec §1; CONSTITUTION §7.1, §12.2). Four themes switchable and persisted; tested.

### 24.9 Proposed Solution — Preferences Persistence & Migration (cross-cutting)

- All new settings — `goPuzzleCountDefault`, `themeDefault`, the optional history `difficulty` tag, and the typed `resumeSlot` — are **additive with safe defaults** that reproduce today's behavior, persisted to guest storage and synced to the Supabase profile via the existing `profile.ts`/`sync.ts`/`storageSchema.ts` plumbing. Bump `GUEST_PROGRESS_SCHEMA_VERSION` once (if the shape changes) with a single forward-compatible migration that preserves all existing coins/XP/level/history/stats/settings (CONSTITUTION §15). No data loss; corrupt payloads still fall back to a fresh default.

### 24.10 Phase 19 — Sub-Phase Plan

| Sub-phase | `phase_id` | Title | Files Touched (planned) | Verification |
|-----------|-----------|-------|-------------------------|--------------|
| 19.0 | 46 | Pre-flight & baseline + planning-stage governance/repo cleanup + README polish + **this §24 addendum** — **done in planning stage** | `AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` (this §24, v2.1), `README.md` (status/feature polish), `CHANGELOG.md`, `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-46.md` | Markdown-only; baseline re-confirmed green (lint, test **292/292**, build, tsc-api); `git diff --check`; GPT-5 grep = 0 |
| 19.1 | 47 | Enhanced Stats Dashboard (interactive accessible charts; no new heavy dep) | **New**: `src/stats/charts/*`, pure stat selectors; **Edit (additive)**: `src/stats/StatsDashboard.tsx`, `statistics.ts`/`types.ts`, optional additive `difficulty?` on `GameHistoryEntry` | Unit tests for selectors; responsive + a11y (axe/keyboard/SR); existing numbers preserved |
| 19.2 | 48 | Configurable Go Puzzle Count (5/7/10; global + per-game; lock-on-start) | **Edit (additive)**: `src/game/constants.ts`, `src/game/go/session.ts`, `src/app/games/GoGame.tsx`, `CustomizeMenu.tsx`, `src/account/storageSchema.ts` (additive setting + migration) | Tests for 5/7/10 chains + carry-over; lock-after-start; daily length stays 5; distinctness holds |
| 19.3 | 49 | Resume Most-Recent Unfinished Game (typed slot + capture/clear + button + signed-in auto-resume) | **Edit**: `src/account/storageSchema.ts` (typed `resumeSlot` + migration), `guestStorage.ts`, `guestTransfer.ts`, `src/app/App.tsx` + home UI, `OgGame.tsx`/`GoGame.tsx` | E2E start→leave→resume (og+go); button hidden when none; signed-in auto-resume; transfer preserves slot |
| 19.4 | 50 | Advanced Polish & Accessibility (animations, sound categories, touch targets, final a11y pass) | **Edit**: `src/sound/*`, animation/CSS, touch-target tweaks | Manual multi-device + axe/Lighthouse; reduced-motion; toggles off-by-default where appropriate |
| 19.5 | 51 | Light Theming Foundation (4 accent themes; profile storage; accent/border-only) | **Edit**: Settings/Customize, `src/account/auth.ts`/`profile.ts` (theme storage), CSS variables, `storageSchema.ts` (additive setting + migration) | 4 themes switchable + persisted (guest + Supabase); no layout/contrast/tile-color change |
| 19.6 | 52 | Final Integration & Release Gate (cross-feature tests, changelog, progress, full verification) | docs/changelog/progress only | Full §24.11 pipeline + CodeQL + Vercel preview smoke; "safe to merge & test" statement |

Each sub-phase ends with a `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md`, a `progress/PROGRESS.csv` row, a `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and a halt for explicit user approval per CONSTITUTION §4 unless the user authorizes contiguous execution.

> **Phase-id note (3-prompt workflow).** Phase 19.0 (planning, Prompt 1) is recorded at `phase_id = 46` — the next sequential id after Phase 18.9 (`phase_id = 45`). This intentionally diverges from the literal Prompt-1 text ("create `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-37.md`"), because step 37 already records Phase 18.1; see §24.2 for the rationale (preserve existing data). **The user reviewed and confirmed this `phase_id = 46` decision in Prompt 2.** The Prompt 2 constitution/repo adjustments (this amendment) are recorded at the next sequential id, **`phase_id = 47`** (`progress/PROGRESS-STEP-47.md`). The feature sub-phases 19.1–19.6 retain the **projected** `phase_id` values 47–52 in the table above for planning purposes; because Prompt 2 consumed id 47, their **final** ids are assigned sequentially from **48** onward as each is executed in Prompt 3.

### 24.11 Verification & Release Gate (Phase 19.6)

1. `npm run lint` — clean.
2. `npm run test` — all existing tests pass with zero new failures; new tests added per sub-phase (stat selectors; Go counts 5/7/10 + lock; resume round-trip; theme persistence; migration back-compat).
3. `npm run build` — clean; record bundle-size delta; **confirm no new heavy charting dependency** and that daily-mode (length 5) stays fast.
4. `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` — clean.
5. Client-bundle leak checks against `dist/`: no `@vercel/blob`; no service-role/Supabase admin secrets; no HF-URL regression vs. the Phase 17/18 baseline.
6. Manual smokes: enhanced stats render + are keyboard/SR accessible; Go count 5/7/10 with lock-on-start and correct carry-over; resume button appears only when unfinished, restores state, signed-in auto-resume; polish/sound categories/touch targets; four themes switch and persist (guest + signed-in); daily 5-lock and practice 2–35 intact.
7. CodeQL on changed lines; fix any true-positive before the gate closes.

### 24.12 Phase 19 Exit Checklist

- Enhanced statistics dashboard ships interactive, accessible visualizations derived from existing stats/history/progression, with **no new heavy dependency**; all current numbers preserved.
- Configurable Go puzzle count (5/7/10) with global default + per-game override + lock-on-start; daily per-puzzle length stays 5; carry-over correct for all counts.
- Resume-most-recent-unfinished-game fully activated: typed `resumeSlot`, capture/clear, home-screen button (only when unfinished), signed-in auto-resume; guest-transfer preserves the slot; data-preserving migration.
- Advanced polish: smoother animations, categorized sound effects, improved touch targets, final a11y pass (axe/Lighthouse), reduced-motion respected.
- Light theming foundation: four accent/border-only themes (default Icy = current look), persisted to guest + Supabase profile; no layout/contrast/tile-color change.
- All Phase 0–18 invariants intact: daily 5-letter lock; practice 2–35; valid guesses identical across difficulty tiers (answers-only subsetting); default difficulty Expert; `getTileStates`/Hard Mode untouched; per-mode stats separation.
- New settings additive with defaults reproducing today's behavior; single forward-compatible migration; no data loss; no file deletion; no weakened tests; no secrets; no service-role on client.
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-*.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` updated and free of sensitive data.
- Progress-step numbering deviation (planning recorded at `PROGRESS-STEP-46.md`, not `37`) **confirmed by the user in Prompt 2** (§24.2); Prompt 2 itself recorded at `phase_id = 47`, with feature sub-phases 19.1–19.6 assigned final ids 48+.
- Halt for explicit user approval ("Start Prompt 2" or equivalent) before any game code changes, and before any production release action.

## 25. Phase 20 – Dramatic UI/Layout Exploration (Addendum, PHASE-20-DRAMATIC-UI-LAYOUT-EXPLORATION-SPEC-2026-05-30)

**Plan Version**: 2.3 (addendum). Bound by `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.3, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`, the prior plan (Phases 0–19), and `PHASE-20-DRAMATIC-UI-LAYOUT-EXPLORATION-SPEC-2026-05-30.md` (the binding source of truth for this phase). Triggered by the user's Phase 20 spec requesting dramatic UI/layout exploration while preserving every existing mechanic, feature, and behavior exactly.

> Status: **Phase 20 Prompt 1 governance setup complete (`phase_id = 54`)**. This prompt upgrades the constitution for multi-agent workflow, appends this §25 addendum, and records progress. **No layout code, UI implementation, auth fix, game logic, word-list filtering, source files, or tests changed in Prompt 1.** Halt for explicit user approval before Prompt 2 or any Phase 20 implementation.

### 25.1 Scope, Source of Truth, and Operating Rules

- **Source of truth for this phase**: `PHASE-20-DRAMATIC-UI-LAYOUT-EXPLORATION-SPEC-2026-05-30.md` and this §25. If either conflicts with earlier plan language for the narrow concerns of sign-out repair or layout exploration, stop and ask the user; do not infer.
- **Phase goal**: explore and iterate a dramatically improved brrrdle UI/layout that feels premium, modern, immersive, game-like, responsive, polished, and future-proof for later theming work, while preserving all existing gameplay, data, auth, stats, sharing, definitions, settings, accessibility, PWA, and persistence behavior.
- **Phase boundary**: Phase 20 is only the sign-out bug fix plus dramatic UI/layout exploration. No new game modes, no word-list filtering, no canonical game-logic changes, no new monetization mechanics, and no Phase 21 theming/effects work.
- **One variant at a time**: never generate, implement, present, or compare multiple full layout variants in a single review cycle. Finish the active variant's preview/review loop before starting another.
- **Preview before commit/merge**: every layout variant must be shown with a live Vercel preview link whenever available. If a live preview is not available, provide detailed screenshots plus a component breakdown before committing, merging, or carrying the variant forward.
- **Explicit approval required**: no layout code may be committed, merged, or treated as selected until the user explicitly approves that variant. Silence or casual feedback is not approval.
- **About Brrrdle surface**: keep About Brrrdle as a dedicated page-compatible surface, not a required tab-only section, so it can fit whichever final layout wins.
- **Reference-driven design allowed**: Codex and sub-agents may draw heavy inspiration from user-linked websites, games, or design references, but must not copy assets or behavior in a way that breaks project scope, accessibility, or licensing expectations.
- **Multi-agent fit**: if sub-agents are used, the coordinating agent assigns non-overlapping work packets, keeps only one active review variant, consolidates reports, and reruns verification before any gate closes.

### 25.2 Phase 20.0 — Critical Sign-Out Bug Fix (Required First)

The first implementation sub-phase must fix the broken sign-out button reported in the spec: after a user signs in, clicking sign out currently does nothing. This must be completed and verified before any layout variant work begins.

Required implementation behavior:

- Locate the failing sign-out path across `src/app/App.tsx`, `src/account/auth.ts`, `src/account/ProfilePanel.tsx`, `src/account/Settings.tsx`, `src/account/AuthPanel.tsx`, and any tests or mocks that cover Supabase auth.
- Ensure clicking sign out calls the Supabase sign-out path, closes account/profile surfaces as appropriate, clears authenticated UI state, returns the app to an anonymous/unconfigured-safe state, and displays a safe user-facing failure message if the provider rejects the sign-out.
- Preserve guest progress, local settings, stats, history, and resume behavior. Signing out must not reset local guest data unless the user explicitly uses reset/delete flows.
- Add or update focused tests for successful sign-out, sign-out failure messaging, and no accidental local-progress reset.
- Verify auth surfaces manually or with component tests before moving to layout exploration.

### 25.3 Layout Variant Workflow

After 20.0 is verified, each variant follows the same strict loop:

1. **Pre-flight**: re-read this §25 and the spec, inspect current UI files, confirm no dirty unrelated changes, and define the single variant concept in one paragraph.
2. **Implement one variant only**: edit only the minimum UI/layout files required for the active concept. Preserve all props, callbacks, state flows, game mechanics, and existing accessible semantics unless the change improves accessibility without behavior loss.
3. **Verify locally**: run lint, tests, build, API typecheck, and targeted manual/browser checks on mobile/tablet/desktop viewports. Include auth sign-out smoke coverage because 20.0 is a prerequisite.
4. **Preview first**: provide a live Vercel preview link when possible. If unavailable, provide screenshots for key viewports and a concise component breakdown.
5. **User review**: wait for explicit feedback. Iterate the same variant if requested, or abandon it and start a new single variant only when the user asks.
6. **Selection and polish**: once the user chooses a clear favorite, refine only that layout, clean up temporary experimentation, update README screenshots, update CHANGELOG and progress files, rerun full verification, and halt for merge approval.

### 25.4 Final Layout Success Criteria

The final selected Phase 20 layout must:

- Feel materially more polished, engaging, and impressive than the current minimalist UI.
- Preserve all existing behavior exactly: `og`, `go`, daily 5-letter lock, practice 2–35, difficulty tiers, configurable Go count, resume, stats, economy, auth/sync, Word Explorer, definitions, sharing, PWA, sound, and light accent themes.
- Stay responsive and polished on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
- Preserve WCAG AA goals, keyboard navigation, visible focus, status announcements, reduced-motion support, and readable contrast.
- Keep the codebase cleaner and more extensible for future Phase 21 theming/effects work.
- Include updated root `README.md` screenshots of the chosen layout before Phase 20 closes.

### 25.5 Phase 20 Sub-Phase Plan

| Sub-phase | `phase_id` | Title | Scope | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 20 Prompt 1 | 54 | Governance setup and addendum | `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.3; §25 addendum; progress/changelog tracking | Markdown/governance only; confirm no source changes; `git diff --check`; CSV parse; install baseline |
| 20.0 | 55 | Critical sign-out fix | Minimal auth/UI fix for sign-out button | Focused auth tests; lint; test; build; API typecheck; manual sign-out smoke |
| 20.1 | 56 | Variant 1 pre-flight and implementation | One dramatic layout concept only | Local checks plus live Vercel preview or screenshots before commit/merge |
| 20.N | 57+ | Additional single variants or iterations | Only if the user requests another variant or iteration | Same one-variant loop; each variant gets its own progress row/report |
| 20 final | TBD | Selected layout polish and release gate | Polish chosen layout, README screenshots, cleanup, progress/changelog | Full verification matrix; preview reviewed; explicit user approval before merge/release |

The final ids after 20.1 are assigned sequentially in `progress/PROGRESS.csv` as the user requests variants or iterations. Never overwrite existing progress reports.

### 25.6 Verification and Release Gate

Before declaring any Phase 20 implementation sub-phase complete:

1. `npm run lint` — clean.
2. `npm run test` — all existing tests pass with zero weakened/removed tests.
3. `npm run build` — clean.
4. `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` — clean.
5. `git diff --check` — clean.
6. Client-bundle leak check where source changes touch auth, data, API-adjacent, or build surfaces: no `@vercel/blob`, service-role strings, privileged credentials, or new secret-like values in client chunks.
7. Manual/browser smoke: sign-out works; daily/practice `og` and `go` still playable; resume still works; stats/settings/Word Explorer/definitions/sharing still accessible; responsive mobile/tablet/desktop layout; keyboard-only navigation; reduced-motion behavior; no critical console errors.
8. Live Vercel preview link preferred for every layout variant; screenshots plus component breakdown acceptable only when preview is unavailable.

Phase 20 must halt before any merge or production release. The user must explicitly approve the selected variant and any merge/release action.

### 25.7 Phase 20 Exit Checklist

- Sign-out bug fixed first and verified.
- Exactly one layout variant active per review cycle.
- Preview provided before any layout commit/merge; user explicitly approved the selected layout.
- Final layout polished and README screenshots updated.
- All existing features and invariants preserved, including auth, stats, sync, game logic, daily/practice constraints, word data, economy, definitions, sharing, PWA, accessibility, and current light themes.
- `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, relevant `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-*.md`, and `CHANGELOG.md` updated with no secrets.
- Full verification matrix and manual responsive/accessibility smoke checks documented.
- Halt for explicit user approval before merge and before any production release.

## 26. Phase 21 – UI Polish & Theming Foundation (Addendum, PHASE-21-UI-POLISH-AND-THEMING-FOUNDATION-SPEC-2026-06-01)

**Plan Version**: 2.5 (addendum). Bound by `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.3, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`, the prior plan (Phases 0–20), and `PHASE-21-UI-POLISH-AND-THEMING-FOUNDATION-SPEC-2026-06-01.md` (the binding source of truth for this phase). Triggered by the user's Phase 21 spec requesting that the finalized Phase 20 "Lunar Signal Deck" layout be polished and upgraded — UI, components, and CSS architecture — into a sophisticated, consistent, extensible foundation that is ready for advanced theming in Phase 22, while preserving every existing mechanic 100% intact.

> Status: **Phase 21 Prompt 1 (planning + governance) complete (`phase_id = 59`)**; **Phase 21 Prompt 2 (governance-only refined-instruction update) complete (`phase_id = 60`)**; **Phase 21 Prompt 3 (full execution) complete (`phase_id = 61`)**. Prompt 1 appended this §26 addendum, updated the phase index, and recorded progress. Prompt 2 records the user's refined instructions (minimalist default background; current Lunar Signal Deck visual style preserved as one Phase 22 theme) into the spec, this section, the changelog, and progress tracking. Prompt 3 implemented the foundation: a new `src/theme/surface.ts` surface-theme module (`minimal` default + `lunar-signal`), a minimalist near-black default backdrop with a faint static grid, the original Lunar Signal Deck treatment (signal glow, animated star/moon canvas, scan grid, custom cursor) captured as the single opt-in `lunar-signal` surface gated by a `data-surface` attribute, and a CSS-architecture cleanup that removed dead Phase-20 exploration styles (the `prism` and `command-shell` shells plus the unused `Layout` component). The Lunar Signal Deck **layout and tab structure are preserved**, and every gameplay mechanic, accent theme, stat, definition, auth/sync, resume, economy, and sharing behavior is unchanged. The Phase 22 dramatic theming system itself is **not** implemented — only the foundation.

### 26.0 Refined User Instructions (Prompt 2 Addendum)

After Prompt 1, the user provided additional binding instructions that must be reflected before any Phase 21 implementation begins. They are recorded here as governance-only clarifications (no code changed in Prompt 2):

- Keep the overall **Lunar Signal Deck layout and tab structure** mostly the same.
- Make the **background very minimalist** (plain black or a simple grid pattern is preferred); tone down the current heavier background treatment (aurora bands, glow, depth effects) to this minimalist baseline for the default surface.
- Turn the current Lunar Signal Deck visual style (background, effects, etc.) into **one individual theme** to be enabled in Phase 22 — preserved as a selectable theme rather than the permanent default background.
- The agent **may** polish, upgrade, and improve visual effects, sounds, animations, component structure, and CSS architecture, as long as nothing is broken or significantly removed.
- The agent must **not** change any core gameplay mechanics, word logic, daily/practice rules, difficulty tiers, definitions, stats, economy, auth/sync, resume, sharing, or any other essential features.

These refined instructions take precedence over earlier §26 language where they conflict on the narrow concerns of the default background and the treatment of the Lunar Signal Deck visual style.


### 26.1 Scope, Source of Truth, and Operating Rules

- **Source of truth for this phase**: `PHASE-21-UI-POLISH-AND-THEMING-FOUNDATION-SPEC-2026-06-01.md` and this §26. If either conflicts with earlier plan language for the narrow concerns of UI polish or theming-foundation preparation, stop and ask the user; do not infer.
- **Phase goal**: take the finalized Phase 20 "Lunar Signal Deck" layout and polish/upgrade the entire UI and codebase so it is significantly more sophisticated, consistent, extensible, and ready for advanced, visually awesome theming in Phase 22.
- **Phase boundary**: Phase 21 is UI polish plus a theming *foundation* only. It does **not** implement the Phase 22 dramatic theming system, nor any other future-phase features (consumables shop, calendar, multiplayer, etc.). Only prepare the foundation; do not build future-phase features.
- **Preserve every mechanic 100% intact**: all existing gameplay, data, auth, sync, stats, definitions, sharing, PWA, sound, settings, resume, economy, accessibility, and current accent themes must behave exactly as before. No regressions are acceptable.
- **About Brrrdle remains a dedicated page**: keep the About Brrrdle section as its own dedicated page/route.
- **Maximum autonomy with guardrails**: maximum autonomy is allowed as long as nothing significant is broken or removed; `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.3 governs at all times.
- **One major change set at a time where possible**, using the established 2-prompt workflow (this planning addendum first, then execution).
- **Update tracking surfaces after every major step**: `CHANGELOG.md`, `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, and `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` must be updated after each major step.

### 26.2 Core Objectives (from the spec)

1. Polish and refine the current Lunar Signal Deck layout to the highest professional standard, keeping the overall layout and tab structure mostly the same while adopting a very minimalist default background (plain black or a simple grid pattern).
2. Improve code organization, component structure, and CSS architecture to make future theming (Phase 22) much easier and more powerful.
3. Ensure the UI feels cohesive, modern, and impressive while preserving every existing mechanic 100% intact.
4. Prepare the codebase for the upcoming planned phases (22–26) without implementing any of their features yet.
5. Update all progress tracking surfaces, changelog, and documentation.

### 26.3 Strict Rules for Execution (from the spec)

- Maximum autonomy is allowed as long as nothing significant is broken or removed.
- Follow `CONSTITUTION.md` strictly at all times.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md` and progress tracking surfaces (`PROGRESS.csv` + `PROGRESS-STEP-N.md`) after every major step.
- Do not implement features from future phases (theming system, consumables shop, calendar, multiplayer, etc.). Only prepare the foundation.
- Keep the About Brrrdle section as a dedicated page.
- One major change set at a time where possible; use the 2-prompt workflow (planning addendum first, then execution).
- After completing the phase, create a PR and merge it (or instruct the user to do so).

### 26.4 Prompt Workflow

| Prompt | `phase_id` | Title | Scope | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 21 Prompt 1 | 59 | Planning & governance addendum | Append §26; update phase index/header; update progress/changelog | Markdown/governance only; confirm no source changes; `git diff --check`; CSV parse |
| 21 Prompt 2 | 60 | Governance-only refined-instruction update | Record refined instructions (minimalist default background; Lunar Signal Deck visuals → one Phase 22 theme) into spec, §26, changelog, progress | Markdown/governance only; confirm no source changes; `git diff --check`; CSV parse |
| 21 Prompt 3 | 61+ | Full execution of Phase 21 | Polish Lunar Signal Deck layout (mostly preserved); minimalist default background; capture current visual style as one Phase 22 theme; improve component structure and CSS architecture; build theming foundation; update docs/README screenshots | Full verification matrix (§26.6); responsive/accessibility smoke; preview before merge |

The Prompt 3 id(s) are assigned sequentially in `progress/PROGRESS.csv` as the work proceeds. Never overwrite existing progress reports.

### 26.5 Phase Deliverables (from the spec)

1. Polished and upgraded Lunar Signal Deck layout (layout and tab structure mostly preserved) with a very minimalist default background (plain black or a simple grid pattern).
2. Improved theming foundation (CSS variables, component structure, etc.).
3. The current Lunar Signal Deck visual style (background, effects, etc.) captured as **one individual theme** to be enabled in Phase 22 (not the permanent default background).
4. Updated progress files and changelog.
5. Merged PR with the final state.

### 26.6 Success Criteria and Verification Gate

The final Phase 21 result must be:

- Visually cohesive and significantly more polished than before Phase 20.
- Technically excellent and easy to theme in Phase 22.
- Fully responsive and accessible (WCAG AA goals, keyboard navigation, visible focus, status announcements, reduced-motion support, readable contrast).
- Free of any regressions in gameplay, auth, stats, definitions, sync, sharing, PWA, sound, settings, resume, economy, or current accent themes.

Before declaring any Phase 21 implementation step complete:

1. `npm run lint` — clean.
2. `npm run test` — all existing tests pass with zero weakened/removed tests.
3. `npm run build` — clean.
4. `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` — clean.
5. `git diff --check` — clean.
6. Client-bundle leak check where source changes touch auth, data, API-adjacent, or build surfaces: no `@vercel/blob`, service-role strings, privileged credentials, or new secret-like values in client chunks.
7. Manual/browser smoke across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports: daily/practice `og` and `go` still playable; resume, stats, settings, Word Explorer, definitions, sharing, sound, auth/sync, and accent themes intact; About Brrrdle remains a dedicated page; keyboard-only navigation and reduced-motion behavior preserved; no critical console errors; no horizontal overflow.

### 26.7 Phase 21 Exit Checklist

- Lunar Signal Deck layout polished and upgraded to a professional standard, with the overall layout and tab structure mostly preserved and a very minimalist default background (plain black or a simple grid pattern).
- Current Lunar Signal Deck visual style (background, effects, etc.) captured as one individual theme to be enabled in Phase 22, rather than left as the permanent default background.
- Component structure and CSS architecture improved into a clean, extensible theming foundation (CSS variables, tokens, component organization) — without implementing the Phase 22 theming system.
- About Brrrdle kept as a dedicated page.
- All existing features and invariants preserved exactly, including daily 5-letter lock, practice 2–35, difficulty tiers, configurable Go count, resume, stats, economy, auth/sync, Word Explorer, definitions, sharing, PWA, sound, accessibility, and current accent themes.
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, relevant `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-*.md`, and documentation/README screenshots updated with no secrets.
- Full verification matrix and responsive/accessibility smoke checks documented.
- Halt for explicit user approval before merge; create and merge the PR (or instruct the user to do so) only after approval.

### 26.8 Phase 21 Addendum – Theme Proposal Templates (Governance Step)

**Source of truth**: `PHASE-21-THEME-PROPOSAL-TEMPLATES-SPEC-2026-06-02.md` (the binding spec for this addendum) and `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.3. This subsection records the user's requested "§26.1" Phase 21 addendum; because the §26.1–§26.7 numbers were already occupied by the Phase 21 UI Polish & Theming Foundation content above, the addendum is recorded here as §26.8 to preserve existing numbering, and the plan version advances to v2.7 (v2.6 was already consumed by the Phase 21 Prompt 3 full-execution amendment).

> Status: **Governance / planning-only step complete (`phase_id = 62`)**. This step binds the new Theme Proposal Templates spec into the plan, records the target repository structure, and updates the changelog and progress tracking. **No theme code, no proposal Markdown files, no CSV population, and no folder creation were performed in this step.** The finalized Phase 21 surface foundation and every existing mechanic remain 100% intact. Full autonomous execution of the template proposals (the "Prompt 3" creative step) requires explicit user approval.

#### 26.8.1 Purpose

This addendum adds a governance + creative-planning step **before the final Phase 21 PR is merged**. In the execution step (separately approved), 5–10 fully fleshed-out **theme proposal template documents** will be authored so that a later phase (Phase 22 and beyond) can implement complete, sophisticated themes. This subsection is the governance record only; it does not author the templates.

#### 26.8.2 Repository Structure to Use

The spec defines the structure as `Themes/proposals/template-proposals/`, `Themes/proposals/full-proposals/`, `Themes/proposals/theme_proposals.csv`, and `Themes/themes.csv`. On disk this is realized (case- and separator-normalized) as:

- `themes/proposals/template_proposals/` — destination for all Markdown template proposal files (currently empty; populated only in the approved execution step).
- `themes/proposals/full_proposals/` — left empty (reserved for later fully implemented themes).
- `themes/proposals/theme_proposals.csv` — to be populated/updated with every proposed template (planned columns: Template Name, Category/Type, Proposed Date, Status (Template), Markdown File, Description/Notes). Left empty in this governance step.
- `themes/proposals/README.md` — documents the folder structure and purpose (updated in this step).
- `themes/themes.csv` — left untouched (reserved for later actual implemented themes).

These folders and placeholder files already exist in the repository; this step does **not** create new folders.

#### 26.8.3 Planned Deliverables (execution step, separately approved)

- `themes/proposals/README.md` (created/updated — done in this governance step).
- 5–10 Markdown files in `themes/proposals/template_proposals/`, including at minimum: (1) an upgraded "Command Center" / "Frozen Command Center" style template, (2) a reusable Country / Nationality theme template, (3) a reusable Holiday / Special Event theme template, and 2–7 additional diverse categories (e.g., Sci-Fi, Nature, Retro, Cyberpunk, Fantasy, Minimal Neon).
- A populated `themes/proposals/theme_proposals.csv`.

Each proposal Markdown file must use a consistent header: Theme Name; Category / Type; Author; Date; Description; Visual Style (preserving correct/incorrect/absent tile distinctions); Special Effects & Animations; Sound Theme; Component / CSS Changes Needed; Implementation Notes for the implementing agent; Future Extensibility Notes.

#### 26.8.4 Strict Rules for This Addendum

- Follow `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.3 strictly.
- Do **not** implement any actual theme code, create proposal Markdown files, populate the CSV, or create folders in this governance step.
- Preserve the current minimalist default background and the Lunar Signal Deck layout/tab structure.
- Update `CHANGELOG.md`, `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, and the relevant `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` for this governance step (done at `phase_id = 62` / `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-62.md`).
- After the governance updates, halt for explicit user approval before beginning the template-proposal execution step. This addendum must be completed before the final Phase 21 PR is merged.

#### 26.8.5 Prompt Workflow

| Prompt | phase_id | Type | Key activity | Gate |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Addendum Prompt 1 | (spec upload) | Spec authored | User uploads `PHASE-21-THEME-PROPOSAL-TEMPLATES-SPEC-2026-06-02.md` | n/a |
| Addendum Prompt 2 | 62 | Governance / planning addendum | Append §26.8; update header/version, phase index, changelog, progress; update `themes/proposals/README.md` | Markdown/governance only; confirm no source changes; `git diff --check`; CSV parse |
| Addendum Prompt 3 | 63+ | Full execution (separately approved) | Author 5–10 template proposals, populate `theme_proposals.csv`, finalize README | Per-spec verification; halt before merging the final Phase 21 PR |

## 27. Phase 22 – Advanced Calendar / Midnight Handling + Timezone-Aware Daily Reset (Addendum, PHASE-22-CALENDAR-MIDNIGHT-AND-BUGFIXES-SPEC-2026-06-02)

**Plan Version**: 2.8 (addendum). Bound by `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.3, `BRRRDLE-SPEC.md`, `BRRRDLE-OVERVIEW.md`, the prior plan (Phases 0–21 plus the §26.8 addendum), and `PHASE-22-CALENDAR-MIDNIGHT-AND-BUGFIXES-SPEC-2026-06-02.md` (the binding source of truth for this phase). Triggered by the user's Phase 22 spec requesting that the daily puzzle system respect the player's local device time, mitigate easy gaming of the daily reset, add a lightweight cross-page countdown indicator, provide a subtle reset alert (visual + a brand-new unique sound), add a developer-only Simulate Time debug tool, and design the rollover logic modularly so a future multiplayer daily variant can reuse it — all while preserving every existing mechanic 100% intact.

> Status: **Phase 22 Prompt 1 (planning + governance only) complete (`phase_id = 64`)**. This step appends this §27 addendum, makes Phase 22 the active next phase in the Current Phase Index, references the spec, and records the goals, scope, deliverables, verification requirements, and two-prompt workflow. **No daily-rollover, timezone, anti-gaming, countdown, reset-alert, sound, dev-tool, modular-refactor, or bug-fix source code was implemented in this step.** The finalized Phase 21 surface foundation and every existing mechanic remain 100% intact. Full execution (Prompt 2) requires explicit user approval.

### 27.1 Scope, Source of Truth, and Operating Rules

- **Source of truth for this phase**: `PHASE-22-CALENDAR-MIDNIGHT-AND-BUGFIXES-SPEC-2026-06-02.md` and this §27. If either conflicts with earlier plan language on the narrow concerns of daily rollover, timezone handling, the countdown indicator, reset alerts, the dev Simulate Time tool, or the modular daily-reset architecture, stop and ask the user; do not infer.
- **Phase goal**: make the daily puzzle system roll over at **local midnight in the player's device timezone**, add balanced anti-gaming safeguards, surface a non-intrusive cross-page countdown, play a brand-new unique reset alert, ship a dev-only Simulate Time tool, and prepare the rollover logic for a future multiplayer daily variant.
- **Phase boundary**: Phase 22 implements the calendar/midnight/timezone work, the countdown + reset alert, the global Settings toggle, the dev-mode Simulate Time tool, the modular design *preparation*, and any small discovered bug fixes only. It does **not** implement any actual multiplayer daily functionality, the dramatic theming system, a consumables shop, or other future-phase features.
- **Preserve every mechanic 100% intact**: all existing daily completion records, resume slots, per-mode stats, sync behavior, guest/signed-in consistency, and the rest of the app must behave exactly as before. No regressions are acceptable.
- **Strict invariants (must never break)**: daily puzzles remain **exactly 5 letters**; practice mode continues to support lengths **2–35**; no changes to multiplayer, marketplace, or economy systems; guest and signed-in progress/sync remain consistent.
- **Maximum autonomy with guardrails**: the agent may automatically fix small bugs and make obvious improvements discovered during exploration/implementation, documenting every such change in the progress surfaces; `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.3 governs at all times.
- **Update tracking surfaces after every major step**: `CHANGELOG.md`, `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, and `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-N.md` must be updated after each major step.

### 27.2 Primary Goals (from the spec)

1. Daily puzzles roll over at **local midnight** in the player's device timezone (using reliable browser APIs; reasonable for travelers / timezone changes).
2. Mitigate casual gaming of the daily reset via device time manipulation (balanced approach).
3. Add a **non-intrusive countdown indicator** visible on every page/tab by default (toggleable in Settings), clickable to navigate to the daily game, and theme-ready (CSS variables / data attributes).
4. When a new daily becomes available, show a subtle, non-modal visual alert + play a **brand-new unique sound** (not reused from any existing sound) that clearly signals "new daily is available."
5. Add a hidden developer-only "Simulate Time" floating button (dev mode only) with a panel to set a specific date/time, jump by hours/days, and reset to real device time. Must never appear in production builds.
6. Automatically fix any small bugs / make obvious improvements discovered during the work (documented in the progress surfaces).
7. Design the daily reset / rollover logic modularly (e.g., dedicated service or hook) so it can later support a special multiplayer daily variant with separate statistics — without implementing multiplayer in this phase.

### 27.3 Anti-Gaming Policy (balanced, from the spec)

- Allow normal drift and small adjustments (±~2 hours).
- Clamp or ignore forward jumps larger than ~12–24 hours.
- On detection, keep the previous daily or show a clear, friendly message.
- Goal: make casual cheating ineffective without being overly strict.

### 27.4 What Claude Must Do First (Prompt 2, before writing code)

Before writing any Phase 22 code, the agent must:

1. Thoroughly explore and document the current daily puzzle system (generation, completion tracking, storage, rollover logic, and all dependent UI surfaces).
2. Produce a short internal mapping of key files and decision points.
3. Identify where the current rollover decision lives and how timestamps are stored/computed (today this lives in `src/data/daily.ts`, which derives the daily `dateKey` from UTC via `toISOString().slice(0, 10)` and is the primary surface Phase 22 must make timezone-aware).

### 27.5 Scope Summary (from the spec)

**In Scope**

- Local-midnight daily rollover with timezone awareness.
- Balanced anti-gaming safeguards.
- Non-intrusive countdown indicator visible across all pages + clickable + theme-ready.
- Subtle non-modal reset visual alert + brand-new unique reset sound.
- Global Settings toggle that disables the countdown + reset alerts.
- Hidden dev-mode floating Simulate Time button + panel.
- Modular design preparation for a future multiplayer daily variant.
- Any small discovered bug fixes/improvements (documented).
- Tests (including time mocking), documentation, and progress tracking updates.

**Out of Scope**

- Changing daily word length (stays 5).
- Any actual multiplayer implementation.
- Per-tab hide/minimize of the countdown (global toggle only).
- Major UI redesign or new full screens.
- Large-scale refactoring.

### 27.6 Phase Deliverables (from the spec)

1. Updated daily-handling code with local-midnight rollover + anti-gaming logic.
2. Countdown indicator (visible on all pages, clickable, theme-ready) + reset alert (subtle visual + brand-new unique sound).
3. Global Settings toggle for the countdown + alerts.
4. Hidden dev-mode floating Simulate Time button + panel.
5. Modular structure prepared for a future multiplayer daily.
6. New/updated tests (including time mocking).
7. Any discovered bug fixes (documented).
8. Updated `CHANGELOG.md` and progress tracking surfaces.
9. Clear manual testing notes.

### 27.7 Prompt Workflow

| Prompt | `phase_id` | Title | Scope | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 22 Prompt 1 | 64 | Planning & governance addendum | Append §27; bump plan to v2.8; update phase index/roadmap; update changelog + progress | Markdown/governance only; confirm no source changes; `git diff --check`; CSV parse |
| 22 Prompt 2 | 65+ | Full execution of Phase 22 | Timezone-aware local-midnight rollover + anti-gaming; cross-page clickable theme-ready countdown; subtle reset alert + brand-new unique sound; global Settings toggle; dev-mode Simulate Time tool; modular daily-reset design; documented bug fixes; tests (time mocking); manual testing notes | Full verification matrix (§27.8); responsive/accessibility smoke; preview before merge |

The Prompt 2 id(s) are assigned sequentially in `progress/PROGRESS.csv` as the work proceeds. Never overwrite existing progress reports.

### 27.8 Success Criteria and Verification Gate

The final Phase 22 result must:

- Reliably roll over daily puzzles at the player's local midnight.
- Mitigate reasonable gaming attempts via large forward time jumps.
- Show a countdown that is visible across the app, non-intrusive (especially on mobile), clickable, and theme-ready.
- Play the reset alert (subtle visual + brand-new unique sound) when the daily becomes available.
- Correctly disable the countdown + alerts via the Settings toggle.
- Provide a useful dev-mode Simulate Time tool that never appears in production.
- Keep the daily reset logic modular and ready for a future multiplayer daily variant.
- Introduce no regressions in existing behavior, and preserve all strict invariants (§27.1).

Before declaring any Phase 22 implementation step complete:

1. `npm run lint` — clean.
2. `npm run test` — all existing tests pass with zero weakened/removed tests, plus new time-mocking tests for rollover/anti-gaming.
3. `npm run build` — clean.
4. `npx tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` — clean.
5. `git diff --check` — clean.
6. Client-bundle leak check where source changes touch auth, data, API-adjacent, or build surfaces.
7. Manual/browser smoke across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports: local-midnight rollover, anti-gaming clamp, countdown visibility/click/theme-readiness, reset alert + unique sound, Settings toggle, and the dev Simulate Time tool (dev only) all behave per spec; daily/practice `og` and `go`, resume, stats, definitions, sharing, sound, auth/sync, and accent/surface themes intact; no critical console errors; no horizontal overflow.

### 27.9 Phase 22 Exit Checklist

- Timezone-aware local-midnight daily rollover implemented with balanced anti-gaming safeguards.
- Cross-page, clickable, theme-ready countdown indicator implemented.
- Subtle non-modal reset visual alert + brand-new unique reset sound implemented.
- Global Settings toggle disables the countdown + reset alerts.
- Hidden dev-mode floating Simulate Time button + panel implemented and excluded from production builds.
- Daily reset logic refactored into a modular service/hook ready for a future multiplayer daily variant (no multiplayer implemented).
- Any discovered bug fixes/improvements applied and documented.
- All strict invariants preserved (daily = 5 letters; practice 2–35; no multiplayer/marketplace/economy changes; guest/signed-in sync consistent; existing completion records, resume slots, and per-mode stats intact).
- `CHANGELOG.md`, `progress/PROGRESS.csv`, the relevant `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-*.md`, and documentation/manual-testing notes updated with no secrets.
- Full verification matrix and responsive/accessibility smoke checks documented.
- Halt for explicit user approval before creating or merging any PR.

### 27.10 Phase 22 Addendum – Calendar (Central Daily Hub) & Countdown Positioning (Governance Step, PHASE-22-ADDENDUM-CALENDAR-AND-COUNTDOWN-POSITIONING-2026-06-03)

**Source of truth**: `PHASE-22-ADDENDUM-CALENDAR-AND-COUNTDOWN-POSITIONING-2026-06-03.md` (the binding spec for this addendum), `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.3, and the existing Phase 22 work (§27.1–§27.9, the `src/daily/` service, and `DailyCountdown.tsx` from Prompt 2). This subsection extends Phase 22; it is recorded as §27.10 to preserve existing §27.1–§27.9 numbering. The plan version advances to **v2.9** (v2.8 was consumed by the original §27 Prompt 1 amendment).

> Status: **Governance / planning-only step complete (`phase_id = 66`); full execution complete (`phase_id = 67`).** The governance step bound the new Calendar & Countdown Positioning spec into the plan; the execution step then implemented it in full — the Calendar is now the first navigation tab and central hub for all dailies (current + past, OG + GO) with "Play Today's OG/GO" buttons, coin-gated past dailies (fixed **60 coins**, one-guess-permanently-unlocks), past dailies as full daily experiences, the dedicated OG/GO Daily tabs removed (legacy deep links redirect into the Calendar), calendar history fixed to start **January 1, 2025**, and the daily countdown repositioned to the top of the UI. The finalized Phase 21 surface foundation and every existing mechanic — including the Phase 22 Prompt 2 daily-cycle work — remain 100% intact. Halting for explicit user review before creating the Phase 22 PR.

#### 27.10.1 Purpose and Relationship to Prior Phase 22 Work

This addendum builds directly on the modular `src/daily/` service and `DailyCountdown.tsx` created during Phase 22 Prompt 2 (`phase_id = 65`). It adds a full **Calendar** feature that becomes the central hub for accessing both current and past daily puzzles (replacing the previous separate dedicated daily tabs) and repositions the countdown indicator from the bottom to the top of the UI. The local-midnight rollover, anti-gaming guard, reset alert, unique sound, Settings toggle, and dev Simulate Time tool delivered in Prompt 2 are all preserved and reused; the calendar and countdown work layer on top of them.

#### 27.10.2 Calendar Feature (Central Hub for All Dailies)

- **Central navigation role**: the Calendar becomes the **first tab** in the top horizontal navigation and the single source of truth for all daily play (current and historical). The previous separate dedicated "OG Daily" and "GO Daily" tabs are removed / fully integrated into the Calendar experience.
- **Visual design**: a clean monthly calendar view (optional weekly overview); each day clearly indicates OG and GO daily completion status; the current day is prominently highlighted using the Prompt 2 local-midnight logic; current streak and longest streak are displayed prominently on or near the calendar; fully theme-ready via the existing `data-surface` + CSS-variable/accent-token system.
- **Prominent quick-access buttons**: clear, prominent **"Play Today's OG"** and **"Play Today's GO"** buttons for fast access to the current day's dailies.
- **Accessing past dailies**: every calendar day exposes separate OG and GO entry points. Clicking a past day's button opens a confirmation modal offering either (a) pay a fixed coin cost to unlock and play that daily, or (b) cancel/close. Today's dailies load normally with no coin cost.
- **Unlock persistence**: once a user makes **at least one guess** on a past daily instance, that specific instance remains **permanently unlocked** (it does not re-lock after the next calendar day begins).
- **Full daily experience**: unlocked past dailies are treated as full daily experiences — full stats recording, hard-mode support, resume functionality, definitions, etc. — for consistency with current daily play. Partial progress must persist correctly.

#### 27.10.3 Coin Cost for Past Dailies

- One **fixed** coin cost applies to unlocking any past daily, **identical across OG and GO modes**.
- The spec asks the agent to select and justify a specific value in the suggested range **50–75 coins** (≈ the coin earnings from ~5 average-performance practice games). **Recommended value (pending user confirmation): 60 coins** — a round mid-range figure that sits comfortably within the suggested band and is non-trivial without discouraging exploration. The final value is to be confirmed by the user before execution.
- The cost integrates with the existing coin economy and spending paths; no other economy/marketplace changes are introduced.

#### 27.10.4 Countdown Indicator Repositioning

- Move the countdown from the **bottom** of the screen to the **top** of the UI on all pages, in a **context-aware** way:
  - **Landing / Home page**: near the existing daily-puzzle status area and the user login/status information.
  - **Game / tab pages**: near the top-right account/user area (cleanest horizontal placement relative to the account pill; exact placement chosen during execution).
- Keep it non-intrusive (especially on mobile), still clickable (navigates to the current daily), and fully theme-ready.
- The existing global Settings toggle ("Daily countdown & reset alerts") continues to control its visibility and reset-alert behavior.

#### 27.10.5 Strict Rules and Preserved Invariants

- Build on the existing `src/daily/` service and `DailyCountdown.tsx`; do not regress the Prompt 2 rollover/anti-gaming/reset-alert/sound/Settings/dev-tool behavior.
- Preserve every invariant: daily puzzles remain **exactly 5 letters**; practice supports **2–35**; stats, economy (beyond the new fixed past-daily cost), auth/sync, resume behavior, and guest/signed-in consistency all remain intact.
- The calendar and repositioned countdown must feel cohesive with the Lunar Signal Deck layout and the minimalist default surface, and must be fully theme-ready.
- Strictly follow `CONSTITUTION.md` v3.3; update `CHANGELOG.md` and progress tracking after every major step; document any extra improvements discovered; halt for explicit user approval before creating the final Phase 22 PR.

#### 27.10.6 Planned Deliverables (Execution Step, Separately Approved)

1. Fully functional Calendar as the first navigation tab — the central hub for all daily access (current + past, OG + GO).
2. Prominent "Play Today's OG" and "Play Today's GO" buttons on the calendar.
3. Coin-gated unlocking flow for past dailies with the "one guess = permanently unlocked" persistence rule and the confirmed fixed cost.
4. Unlocked past dailies treated as full daily experiences (stats, hard mode, resume, definitions).
5. Repositioned, context-aware countdown at the top of all pages (landing vs. game tabs).
6. Necessary updates to navigation, routing, and state management; removal/integration of the old dedicated daily tabs.
7. Updated tests covering the new flows; documentation of any additional improvements discovered.

#### 27.10.7 Prompt Workflow

| Prompt | `phase_id` | Title | Scope | Verification |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 22 Addendum Prompt 1 | 66 | Calendar & Countdown Positioning planning/governance | Append §27.10; bump plan to v2.9; update phase index; update changelog + progress | Markdown/governance only; confirm no source changes; `git diff --check`; CSV parse |
| 22 Addendum Prompt 2 | 67 | Full execution (separately approved) — **complete** | Added `src/calendar/` (model + `CalendarPanel`) as the central first-tab daily hub with "Play Today's OG/GO" buttons, month grid (Jan 1 2025 → today) with completion/lock badges, OG/GO streak + coin readouts, and a 60-coin unlock confirmation modal; `src/daily/pastDailies.ts` (cost/start-date + unlock helpers); additive `unlockedDailies` persistence + migrate + cloud merge; `affectsStreak` stat flag (past dailies record stats but never patch streaks); per-date daily session storage; OG/GO games accept `pastDailyDateKey` + first-guess unlock; legacy `og-daily`/`go-daily` routes hidden and redirected into the Calendar; countdown moved into the top account stack | `npm run lint` clean; `npm run test` 390/390; `npm run build` succeeds; `tsc -b` clean; `git diff --check` clean; CodeQL reviewed; halt before creating the final Phase 22 PR |

#### 27.10.8 Open Questions / Recommendations for the User — RESOLVED

All four open questions were answered by the user and applied in the `phase_id = 67` execution:

1. **Past-daily coin cost** — Confirmed **60 coins** (fixed; same for OG and GO).
2. **Streak semantics on the calendar** — Confirmed: unlocked past dailies record full stats but do **not** retroactively affect or patch streak continuity (streaks reflect natural current-day play only).
3. **Tab removal scope** — Confirmed: the dedicated OG Daily / GO Daily tabs are fully removed; the Calendar is the single source of truth, and legacy deep links redirect into the Calendar with the appropriate mode/day pre-selected.
4. **Calendar history depth** — Confirmed: fixed start date **January 1, 2025** (not rolling); any daily from 2025-01-01 onward is selectable; earlier days are out of scope.
