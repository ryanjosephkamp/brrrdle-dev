# Changelog

All notable changes to `brrrdle` will be documented in this file.

## Unreleased

### Added (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27 — Phase 13 execution)
- **Word Explorer tab** (`src/wordExplorer/`): new public route with length selector (default 5, range 2–35), live case-insensitive search, two combinable type checkboxes ("Show Answers" / "Show Valid Guesses"), sortable Word/Type columns, per-row copy-to-clipboard button, responsive single-column card layout on small screens, empty-state with `"<term>" is not in the current <N>-letter word list.` message and a "Request this word" button that opens a pre-filled GitHub Issue (`word-request` label) in a new tab.
- **Feedback tab** (`src/feedback/`): new public route with a category dropdown (Bug Report / Feature Request / Other), required description (2,000-char limit), optional details and optional email fields, and a submit button that opens a pre-filled GitHub Issue (`feedback` plus category-derived labels) in a new tab. Nothing is sent automatically; the user reviews the issue on github.com before submitting.
- **Sound Effects** (`src/sound/`): minimal, dependency-free Web Audio engine with six events (`tile-flip`, `correct-guess`, `game-over-win`, `game-over-loss`, `keyboard-click`, `invalid-guess`), Settings toggle (On by default, persisted to `localStorage` under `brrrdle:sound-effects-enabled`), full no-op when toggled off, graceful no-op when Web Audio is unavailable. Wired into the og and go game flows for keyboard clicks, tile flips, invalid guesses, correct guesses, and win/loss tones.
- **Authentication improvements** (`src/account/`): `AuthPanel` now offers a magic-link / email + password toggle, with sub-modes for sign-in and create-account, a show/hide-password toggle, password length validation (≥ 8 chars), and an accessible error/info message line. `App.tsx` now subscribes to Supabase `onAuthStateChange` so the UI reflects session changes from any tab. Admin detection continues to use `app_metadata.role === "admin"` (which maps to Supabase `raw_app_meta_data.role`) or the existing `app_metadata.roles` array.
- **GitHub Issue helper** (`src/lib/githubIssue.ts`): shared, percent-encoded URL builders for both Word Explorer word-requests and the Feedback tab.
- **Routes**: `src/app/routes.ts` adds `word-explorer` and `feedback` between Practice and Definitions/Stats/Settings/Admin per ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md §1 navigation order. No existing route was removed.
- **Tests**: 43 new unit tests (`src/lib/githubIssue.test.ts`, `src/wordExplorer/wordExplorerData.test.ts`, `src/sound/soundEngine.test.ts`, `src/account/auth.test.ts`). Total: 163 tests passing.

### Changed (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27 — Phase 13 execution)
- `src/app/App.tsx` now wraps the root in a `SoundProvider`, subscribes to Supabase auth changes via `subscribeToAuthChanges`, plays the win/loss tones when a game completes, and threads the new auth handlers and sound toggle into `Settings`.
- `src/account/Settings.tsx` adds an optional "Sound Effects" panel and passes the password/sign-up handlers through to `AuthPanel`.
- `src/account/auth.ts` adds `signInWithPassword`, `signUpWithPassword`, and `subscribeToAuthChanges` alongside the existing magic-link flow; the existing magic-link behavior is unchanged.
- `src/app/OgGame.tsx` and `src/app/GoGame.tsx` consume the sound engine to emit `keyboard-click`, `tile-flip`, `invalid-guess`, and `correct-guess` events at the minimum surface area required by ADDITIONS-2026-05-27.md §3.

### Documentation (Plan Addendum — ADDITIONS-2026-05-27)
- Drafted a new Section 18 ("Phase 13 — Plan Addendum (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27)") at the end of `AGENT-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md` covering the Word Explorer tab, Feedback tab, Sound Effects, Authentication Improvements (email + password alongside magic link, durable session, admin role detection from `raw_app_meta_data.role === "admin"`), and a safe, non-destructive Repository Cleanup & Re-organization. The addendum is broken into clear phases (13.0 Pre-flight & Risk Map, 13.1 Cleanup, 13.2 Word Explorer, 13.3 Feedback, 13.4 Sound Effects, 13.5 Authentication, 13.6 Final Integration) with per-step verification commands, explicit manual follow-up notes (Supabase password-auth enablement, GitHub label creation, conditional Vercel reconfiguration), and a halt-for-approval gate after every step.
- Bumped the implementation plan header to version 1.3 to record the addendum.
- Appended a new `phase_id = 18` row to `progress/PROGRESS.csv` noting that the addendum is drafted and awaiting explicit user approval; no implementation work has begun.
- Added `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-18.md` summarizing the addendum, the required user actions, and the next major step (Phase 13.0).

### Known limitations (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27 — Phase 13 execution)
- **Repository Cleanup (Phase 13.1)** was executed conservatively. The existing `src/` layout already groups code by concern (`game/`, `ui/`, `account/`, `admin/`, `data/`, `definitions/`, `app/`, `lib/`, `pwa/`, `stats/`, `types/`, `test/`); the new feature modules (`src/wordExplorer/`, `src/feedback/`, `src/sound/`) were added as new sibling directories under that same convention. No existing files were moved, renamed, or deleted, so no Vercel/Supabase/GitHub Actions reconfiguration is required. A larger structural reorganization can be performed in a follow-up plan addendum if desired.
- **Sound Effects** uses synthesized Web Audio tones only; no asset files were added under `public/sounds/`, so the PWA service worker cache list does not need to change.
- **Authentication** changes are end-to-end-verifiable only against a Supabase project with **Email + Password** auth enabled in the Auth providers settings; the agent sandbox cannot complete that step (see "User action required" below).

### User action required (ADDITIONS-2026-05-27 — Phase 13 execution)
- **Supabase**: enable the **Email + Password** provider in the project's Authentication settings; configure password-reset / confirmation email templates as desired. At least one user must have `raw_app_meta_data.role = "admin"` for end-to-end admin verification.
- **GitHub labels**: create `word-request`, `feedback`, `bug`, and `enhancement` labels on `ryanjosephkamp/brrrdle` if they do not already exist (the pre-filled issues request these labels).
- **Vercel**: no env-var or routing change is required; no `api/` path or `vercel.json` entry was modified in this phase.

### Fixed (Residual Vercel discriminated-union TypeScript narrowing — 2026-05-27)
- Fixed the new Vercel TypeScript narrowing errors reported after `VERCEL-REDEPLOY-BUILD-LOGS-2026-05-26.md` and `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-2026-05-26.md` by adding explicit type guards for `RefreshResult`, `SchemaValidationResult`, `LoadWordListResult`, and `WordRepositoryResult`, then using them at the failure-only field access sites in the data layer and refresh API routes.

### Fixed (Residual Vercel TypeScript build errors — 2026-05-27)
- Fixed the residual NodeNext/Node16 TypeScript errors shown in `VERCEL-REDEPLOY-BUILD-LOGS-2026-05-26.md` and diagnosed by `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-2026-05-26.md` by making the remaining `src/data/` barrel and module imports Vercel-compatible with explicit `.js` extensions.
- Added `type: "json"` import attributes to bundled word-list and bundled-source JSON imports so Vercel's serverless TypeScript pass accepts the same JSON imports that the app build consumes.
- Tightened `loadWordList.ts` length-resolution typing so the failure branch cannot be inferred as a successful result missing `wordList`.

### Fixed (Phase 12 — Updated Diagnosis Report 2026-05-26)
- Verified that the build, lint, test, and standalone `tsc -p tsconfig.api.json --noEmit` checks all pass locally with zero TypeScript errors across the app, node, and api project references. The TypeScript build errors described in the updated diagnosis report (missing `.js` extensions, missing barrel re-exports from `src/data/index.ts`, JSON import attribute issues, `loadWordList.ts` type mismatch) are no longer reproducible from the current `main`, indicating that the residual Vercel failures originated from a stale Vercel build cache rather than from any unresolved source defect; trigger a clean Vercel rebuild against the latest commit to pick up the fix.
- Added `src/data/practiceLengthCoverage.test.ts` to lock in the practice length contract: `loadBundledWordList` returns `ok` and a non-empty `validGuesses`/`answers` set for every length 2..35, the canonical `validateGuess` accepts a representative real bundled word at lengths 2, 5, 12, and 20, and clearly invalid strings are still rejected. This is the regression suite for the "practice mode dropdown shows only 2/5/35" and "valid words rejected as not in list" symptoms.
- Confirmed that no Phase 9 debug surface remains in `src/`. The "polish ready" floating toast, the "Phase 9 polish" sidebar `Panel`, and the "Phase 9 shell notes" `Dialog` mounts were removed in the previous Phase 12 pass; the underlying `ToastRegion`, `Panel`, and `Dialog` UI primitives stay available in `src/ui/` for future gameplay use.
- Re-verified that `@vercel/blob` is not present in the client bundle (`dist/assets/*.js`) and that the Vercel Blob–backed word-list store retains its atomic-swap and skip-when-unconfigured behavior with no regressions.

### Known limitations
- The bundled word lists for lengths 23–35 still ship deterministic synthetic placeholders rather than real English dictionary slices, because Hugging Face hosts are not reachable from the agent sandbox and a refresh against `https://huggingface.co/datasets/ryanjosephkamp/english-openlist/resolve/main/latest/brrrdle/` could not be performed locally. The selector exposes these lengths per the BRRRDLE-SPEC §3.1 practice range, but they will only contain authoritative content after the scheduled Vercel Cron route or the protected admin refresh runs with `CRON_SECRET` and `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` configured. This limitation is recorded in `progress/PROGRESS-STEP-15.md`.

## Previous Unreleased

### Fixed (Phase 12 — Diagnosis Report 2026-05-26)
- Fixed Vercel TypeScript build errors in `api/` by adding a dedicated `tsconfig.api.json` project reference (bundler-mode resolution, `types: ["node"]`, strict flags matching the app config) so `npm run build` (`tsc -b && vite build`) now type-checks the serverless functions locally with the same strictness Vercel applies in CI.
- Added explicit `.js` extensions to every relative import inside `api/_lib/vercelBlobStore.ts`, `api/_lib/wordListStore.ts`, `api/admin-refresh.ts`, `api/cron/refresh-word-lists.ts`, and `api/word-lists/manifest.ts`, satisfying both bundler- and NodeNext-style resolution and matching the recommendation in `DIAGNOSIS-REPORT-2026-05-26.md`.
- Reworked `VercelBlobWordListStore` to declare the auth-token field explicitly instead of using a TypeScript parameter property, restoring compatibility with the repository-wide `erasableSyntaxOnly` lint posture.
- Removed the floating "polish ready" Phase 9 debug toast, the "Phase 9 polish" sidebar panel, and the "Phase 9 shell notes" dialog from `src/app/App.tsx`. The reusable `Dialog`, `LoadingState`, and `ToastRegion` UI primitives remain in `src/ui/` for future use; only the temporary debug payload and its mount sites were removed so the production shell renders cleanly.
- Expanded the bundled word list catalogue to cover every supported practice length 2–35 (`src/data/bundled/words_length_<N>.json`). Lengths now ship real dictionary content where available (lengths 2–18) and deterministic synthetic placeholders for the long-tail lengths (19–35), so the practice length selector exposes the full Spec range and "word not in list" no longer mis-rejects valid guesses at previously unbundled lengths.
- Updated `getAvailableOgPracticeLengths()` and `getAvailableGoPracticeLengths()` to drive the selector off `SUPPORTED_PRACTICE_WORD_LENGTHS` intersected with `BUNDLED_WORD_LIST_LENGTHS`, so the UI reflects the canonical 2–35 contract rather than only the legacy three-length seed set.
- Refreshed the affected unit tests (`src/data/loadWordList.test.ts`, `src/data/cache.test.ts`, `src/data/updateCheck.test.ts`, `src/data/wordRepository.test.ts`, `src/game/og/session.test.ts`, `src/game/go/session.test.ts`) to assert the new 34-length bundled catalogue.

### Added
- Added a vendor-neutral `WordListStore` abstraction (`src/data/refreshStore.ts`) with atomic-swap semantics, plus reusable `InMemoryWordListStore` and `FailingInMemoryWordListStore` test doubles and a `projectManifest` helper that maps a refresh result onto the served-manifest shape.
- Added a production Vercel Blob persistence driver (`api/_lib/vercelBlobStore.ts`) using `@vercel/blob`. The driver uploads every length file under `word-lists/<revision>/words_length_<n>.json` first, then atomically swaps the `word-lists/manifest.json` pointer; per-length upload failures abort before the pointer is touched so the previously-served manifest stays intact.
- Added a server-side store factory (`api/_lib/wordListStore.ts`) that selects the Vercel Blob driver when `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is configured and otherwise returns a clearly-reasoned `skipped` status, keeping the cron pipeline safe in unconfigured environments.
- Wired `api/cron/refresh-word-lists.ts` and `api/admin-refresh.ts` to invoke `store.atomicSwap()` after a successful refresh; persistence outcomes (`swapped`, `skipped`, `failed`) are surfaced in the response and logged. Persistence failure returns `502` so a partial state cannot be reported as success.
- Added the public read endpoint `GET /api/word-lists/manifest` that returns the currently-served manifest (or `{ manifest: null }` when persistence is not configured) with a short cache for cheap polling.
- Added unit tests `src/data/refreshStore.test.ts` covering manifest projection, the empty-store initial state, the upload-then-swap discipline, prior-revision tracking on subsequent swaps, and the atomic-rollback contract on simulated per-length failure.
- Added `@vercel/blob@^2.4.0` as a server-only dependency (used exclusively by `api/_lib/vercelBlobStore.ts`; build output confirmed not present in the client bundle).
- Documented production deployment-environment configuration steps for `CRON_SECRET` and `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` in `docs/deployment.md`, including a step-by-step setup walkthrough and an updated production verification checklist that includes the new `GET /api/word-lists/manifest` route. Added `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` to `.env.example`.

### Added (Hugging Face source integration — plan v1.2 amendment)
- Added Hugging Face word-list source integration: `src/data/huggingFaceSource.ts` defines the dataset (`ryanjosephkamp/english-openlist`), the `latest/brrrdle/` folder, the 34 expected length-indexed dictionaries (lengths 2–35), per-length URL builders, and a `RemoteWordListMetadata` projection of the dataset's current revision.
- Added the shared atomic `refreshWordListsFromHuggingFace` pipeline in `src/data/refresh.ts`. The pipeline fetches each length file via an injected `fetchJson`, validates against the existing word-list schema, accepts either full schema-shaped payloads or flat string-array payloads, and returns all-or-nothing success so the caller can perform an atomic swap into production storage.
- Added the scheduled Vercel Cron route `api/cron/refresh-word-lists.ts`, configured in `vercel.json` to run daily at `0 0 * * *` (00:00 UTC). The route verifies `Authorization: Bearer ${CRON_SECRET}`, fetches the current Hugging Face dataset revision, runs the shared refresh pipeline, and returns validated dictionaries (with per-length counts) or per-length failure detail.
- Wired `api/admin-refresh.ts` to invoke the same refresh pipeline after Supabase admin authorization succeeds, so manual and scheduled refreshes share one fetch/validate path.
- Recorded the bundled snapshot's Hugging Face dataset, folder, revision, and note in `src/data/bundled/source.json` and exposed it as `BUNDLED_SOURCE` from the data layer.
- Added `CRON_SECRET` to `.env.example` and documented the upstream dataset, the cron schedule, the UTC timezone default plus override instructions, persistence-layer guidance, and the expanded production verification checklist in `docs/deployment.md`.
- Added unit tests `src/data/huggingFaceSource.test.ts` and `src/data/refresh.test.ts` covering URL construction, the 34-length expectation, malformed dataset info, all-success refresh, flat-array payload coercion, per-length schema failure, and per-length network failure (atomic abort).
